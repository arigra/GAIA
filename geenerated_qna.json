The word radar (from the acronym Radio Detection and Ranging) was originally used to describe the \nprocess of locating targets by means of reflected radio waves (primary radar) or automatically retransmitted \nradio waves (secondary radar).  The word has now been fully integrated into the English language and, \ndespite being derived from an acronym, is no longer written in capital letters. Today the meaning of radar \nhas been extended to include a much wider variety of techniques in which electromagnetic waves are \nemployed for the purpose of obtaining information relating to distant objects.  It includes not only active \nsystems, in which the energy originates from the system itself, but also semi-active systems, in which the \nenergy originates from some other source; and passive systems which receive energy originating at the \ntarget.\nAn Elementary System \n2. An elementary form of radar consists of a transmitting aerial emitting electromagnetic radiation \ngenerated by a high frequency oscillator, a receiving aerial, and an energy detecting device or receiver.  A \nportion of the transmitted signal is intercepted by a reflecting object (target) and is re-radiated in all directions.  \nThe receiving aerial collects the returned energy and delivers it to a receiver, where it is processed to detect \nthe presence of the target and to extract its location and relative velocity. \n3. The distance to a target is determined by measuring the time taken for the signal to travel to the target \nand back.  The direction, or angular position, of the target may be determined from the direction of arrival of \nthe reflected wavefront.  The usual method of measuring the direction of arrival is with narrow aerial beams.  \nIf relative motion exists between target and radar, the shift in the carrier frequency of the reflected wave \n(doppler effect) is a measure of the target\u2019s relative (radial) velocity and may be used to distinguish moving \ntargets from stationary objects. In radars which continuously track the movement of a target, a continuous \nindication of the rate of change of the target position is also available.\n4.", "question": "What is the basic principle of radar operation?", "answer": "The basic principle of radar operation involves transmitting electromagnetic radiation, which is then reflected off a target and received back by the radar system. The time taken for the signal to travel to the target and back is measured to determine the distance, while the direction of arrival of the reflected wavefront is used to determine the target's direction or angular position. If relative motion exists, the shift in the carrier frequency of the reflected wave (doppler effect) can indicate the target's relative (radial) velocity."}, {"context": "4. To summarize, the information that can be communicated by radar consists mainly of: \na. Range - by echo timing. \nb. Relative radial velocity - by measuring Doppler shift. \nc. Angular position - by observing the direction of echo arrival. \nd. Target identity - by using secondary radar. \nClassification of Radar Systems \n5. The profusion of radar systems in use today necessitates a logical means of classification.  One \nmethod, which appears to have achieved general acceptance, is to classify a radar system according \nto four main characteristics, namely: \na. Installation environment (ground, airborne, etc).\nb. Functional characteristics (search, track, etc). \nc. Transmission characteristics (pulse, CW, etc). \nd. Operating frequency band.", "question": "What is one method of classifying a radar system?", "answer": "One method of classifying a radar system is according to four main characteristics: installation environment, functional characteristics, transmission characteristics, and operating frequency band."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-1 - Introduction to Radar \nRevised Jul 10  Page 2 of 8 6. By this method, an early warning radar might be classified as a ground search, pulse radar operating in \nD-band, and an airborne interception radar as an airborne, search and track, pulse-Doppler radar operating \nin I-band.  Such statements provide a useful qualitative description of a radar system. \n7. Installation Environment.  The main types of radar installation are ground systems (static, \nground-transportable and air-transportable), airborne systems (aircraft, missile and satellite), and ship-\nborne systems. \n8.Functional Characteristics. Radar systems may perform either a single function or, as is common in \nairborne applications, one of a number of functions.  Multi-mode radars can offer operational flexibility, but \nsome compromise is usually entailed.  Some important radar functions include the following: \na.Search and Detection. The interrogation of a given volume of space for the presence or\nabsence of targets is one of the most important functions of radar.  This is normally achieved by a \nprimary search radar which scans the volume to be searched by moving a concentrated beam of \nenergy in a repeated pattern.  The beam may either be fan-shaped and scan in a single \ndimension, or it may be pencil-shaped and scan in two-dimensions.  The time required to \ncomplete each scan cycle is dependent on the ratio of the solid angle searched to that of the radar \nbeam, and to minimize this time it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice either coverage or the \nangular precision of the beam. \nb.Identification. If the volume interrogated is likely to contain both friendly and hostile targets, \nan important function of radar is the identification of friend or foe (IFF). This is normally achieved\nby secondary radar, in which transponding equipment carried in the friendly aircraft transmits \nreplies in response to coded transmissions received from the interrogating radar.  The \ninterrogation may be performed either by the search radar or by a separate system.  Other criteria \nmay sometimes be used to establish the identity of a target, eg by comparing the parameters of a \ncomputed ballistic trajectory with predetermined values. \nc. Tracking.", "question": "What is the main function of a primary search radar in a radar system?", "answer": "The main function of a primary search radar in a radar system is to interrogate a given volume of space for the presence or absence of targets by scanning the volume to be searched with a concentrated beam of energy in a repeated pattern."}, {"context": "c. Tracking.  Numerous tactical situations require continuous target information for display \npurposes, e.g. airborne interception, or for calculation of relative target motion or future position.  \nTracking radars which perform these functions must be capable of producing continuous outputs \nof the range and angular co-ordinates of the selected target and, in some cases, the rates of \nchange of these parameters.\nd.Target Illumination.  Target illumination is the function performed by the active element in \nsemi-active radar. The illuminating radar must be capable of tracking the selected target whilst\nthe passive receiver carried in the homing missile intercepts the radiated energy after reflection \nfrom the target.  The information communicated to the missile consists of target direction only, but \nif the missile is roughly on the line between the illuminating radar and target, and can receive the \nenergy directly as well as by reflection, its range to the target is approximately proportional to the\ndifference in the times of arrival of the direct and reflected signals. \ne.Mapping.  Mapping by airborne radar has numerous military applications of which navigation, \nbombing and reconnaissance are perhaps the most noteworthy. Other functions employing\nspecialized mapping techniques are submarine detection, cloud warning and terrain avoidance.  \nMapping radars may employ either circular or sector scan.  Alternatively, the aerial beams may be \nfixed in direction and scanned by the motion of the aircraft.  Mapping is normally performed by \nactive pulse radar but passive systems which intercept naturally radiated infra-red energy are also\npossible.", "question": "What is the function of target illumination in semi-active radar?", "answer": "Target illumination in semi-active radar is the function performed by the active element, which involves the illuminating radar tracking the selected target while the passive receiver carried in the homing missile intercepts the radiated energy after reflection from the target. The information communicated to the missile consists of target direction, and if the missile is roughly on the line between the illuminating radar and target, its range to the target is approximately proportional to the difference in the times of arrival of the direct and reflected signals."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-1 - Introduction to Radar \nRevised Jul 10  Page 3 of 8 f.Navigation.  Numerous navigational functions may be performed by radar: \n(1) Mapping radars can provide fixing facilities and both cloud and terrain warning. \n(2) Height can be measured by a radar altimeter. \n(3) Secondary radar techniques are used in various forms of navigational beacon, e.g. DME \nand TACAN. \n(4) Ground speed and drift can be measured by means of Doppler radar. \ng.Other Radar Functions. This is by no means an exhaustive list of radar functions.  Among the \nless familiar secondary functions which may sometimes be incorporated in a radar system are: \n(1) Passive operation for the detection and location of enemy radiation. \n(2) Radiation of jamming signals.\n(3) Use of the radar transmission as a carrier for communicating intelligence. \n9. Transmission Characteristics.  The most fundamental basis for classifying a radar system is \nprovided by its transmission characteristics because on this depends the nature of the target information \nwhich the system is inherently capable of conveying.  The ability to convey target information is provided by \nmodulating the transmission in various ways, and by observing in the receiver the manner in which the echo \nsignal has been affected by the target.  Directional information is achieved by the radar aerial which \nmodulates the transmission into a narrow beam (space modulation). Range information necessitates the \nprovision of timing marks in the transmitted carrier in order to facilitate the measurement of the propagation \ntime to and from the target.  This may be achieved by modulating amplitude (pulse radar) or frequency \n(FMCW radar).  The measurement of relative velocity between target and radar is achieved by observing the \nchange of frequency in the echo signal brought about by the Doppler effect.  For this to be possible, both the \nfrequency and phase of the transmission must be present in a reference signal at the time the echoes are \nreceived.  This condition is inherent in a continuous wave (CW) radar and in coherent, pulse and Doppler \nradar; but in the majority of pulse radars the Doppler shift, although present, cannot be measured.", "question": "What is the function of mapping radars in navigation?", "answer": "Mapping radars can provide fixing facilities and both cloud and terrain warning."}, {"context": "The \nfundamental division in radar types lies between pulse systems (which resolve targets in range) and \ncontinuous wave systems (which resolve targets in velocity).  Other types, such as pulse Doppler, can \nperform both functions if required to do so. \n10. The main features of the fundamental radar classifications are as follows: \na.Pulse Radar.  In pulse radar, the transmission is concentrated into very short pulses which \nare separated by sufficiently long intervals to permit all echoes from targets within the operating \nrange to be received from one pulse before transmission of the next.  Targets are resolved in \nrange by virtue of the different times of arrival of their echoes and the degree of resolution being \ndetermined by the length of the pulses.  Range measurement (R) is made by observing the \nelapsed time (t (in microseconds)) between the leading edge of the transmitted pulse leaving the \naerial and the leading edge of the return echo arriving back at the aerial.  Because the pulse has \ntravelled to the target and back, t therefore equals 2 \u00d7 R.  If c is the velocity of propagation \n(3 \u00d7 108 metres per second), then: \n2ctR andcR 2t\n==\nb. Moving Target Indication (MTI) Radar.  MTI radar employs a pulsed transmission but, in \naddition to performing range resolution and measurement, it also discriminates between fixed and", "question": "What is the main feature of pulse radar that allows it to resolve targets in range?", "answer": "The main feature of pulse radar that allows it to resolve targets in range is the use of very short pulses, separated by long intervals, which allows all echoes from targets within the operating range to be received from one pulse before transmission of the next. The different times of arrival of the echoes and the length of the pulses determine the degree of resolution in range."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-1 - Introduction to Radar \nRevised Jul 10  Page 4 of 8 moving targets by its ability to recognize the existence or absence of Doppler shift in the echo \nsignals.  The fixed targets are suppressed and only moving targets displayed. \nc. Continuous Wave Radar.  In CW radar, the transmitted and received signals are continuous \nand targets are resolved in relative velocity by virtue of the differing frequencies in their echoes.  \nThe measurement of relative radial velocity is made by observing the magnitude of the Doppler \nshift (f d) in the echo signals, ie the difference in frequency between the transmitted and received \nsignals.  If the relative velocity is \u00b1V, and\u03bbis the transmitted wavelength, then:\u03bbV 2fd \u00b1 =\nd.Frequency Modulated CW (FMCW) Radar.  FMCW radar employs a continuous \ntransmission in which the frequency is modulated.  In addition to performing velocity resolution \nand measurement, the system has the ability to measure the range of a discrete target, but it \ncannot resolve a number of targets at differing ranges other than by virtue of their differing \nvelocities or directions.  The measurement of range is less precise than that of a pulse radar at \nmedium and long ranges but can be more accurate at short range.  In addition, FMCW can \nmeasure down to zero range, which is not possible with a pulse system. \ne.Pulse Doppler Radar.  Pulse Doppler radar employs a transmission in which, unlike \nconventional pulse radar, there is continuity in the phase of the carrier from pulse to pulse.  This \nproperty, called coherence, permits the Doppler shift in echoes to be measured and the system is \nthus able to resolve and measure both range and relative velocity. The avoidance of ambiguity in\nvelocity measurement requires the pulse repetition frequency to be higher than in conventional \npulse radar and, as a result, potential ambiguity is introduced into the measurement of range and \nrange eclipsing may occur.  Nevertheless, sophisticated processing techniques have meant that \npulse Doppler radar is the most important and widely used type in airborne applications.\n11. Operating Frequency Band.", "question": "What is the difference in range measurement between FMCW and pulse radar?", "answer": "The range measurement of a FMCW radar is less precise than that of a pulse radar at medium and long ranges, but it can be more accurate at short range. Additionally, FMCW radar can measure down to zero range, which is not possible with a pulse system."}, {"context": "11. Operating Frequency Band.  Modern radar systems operate over a wide range of frequencies, \nusually between about 200 and 35,000 MHz, ie wavelengths between 1.5 metres and rather less than \none centimetre. Within this range, radar systems tend to be grouped in a number of fairly distinct\nregions, partly because of frequency allocation and partly because of constructional convenience.  \nFig 1 gives the system of frequency classification used by the NATO Forces and summarizes the effect \nof operating frequency on the following characteristics of radar systems: \na. Resolution.  The ability of radar to resolve detail in angle, range, or velocity is directly related to \ntransmission frequency.  With increasing frequency, the beamwidth for a given physical aerial size \ncan be made narrower, pulselengths may be shorter and the Doppler frequency shift for a given \ntarget velocity becomes greater.  For these reasons, the inherent resolving power of radar improves \nin all dimensions with increasing frequency. \nb. Size and Weight.  The physical dimensions of radar components, eg power oscillators, \nwaveguides, aerials, etc, are fundamentally related to the transmission wavelength.  Size and \nweight of equipment, therefore, reduce with increasing frequency and it is mainly for this reason \nthat airborne systems usually operate at I band frequencies and above.\nc. Power Handling Capacity.  The power handling capacity, and hence performance, of a radar \nsystem is mainly limited by the physical dimensions of its power oscillator and waveguides, the capacity \nbeing reduced with increased frequency.\nd. Propagational Aspects. A number of propagational aspects are affected by the transmission \nfrequency.  Above 10,000 MHz, 3 cm wavelength, attenuation due to both atmospheric gases and rain \nbegins to be significant and above 35,000 MHz it becomes prohibitively high for most purposes, \nalthough there are some windows giving opportunity for use around 32-35 GHz and 94 GHz.\nSusceptibility to unwanted clutter is another aspect which tends to get worse as frequency rises.  Finally,", "question": "What are the factors that affect the resolution of radar systems?", "answer": "The resolution of radar systems is directly related to the transmission frequency. With increasing frequency, the beamwidth for a given physical aerial size can be made narrower, pulselengths may be shorter, and the Doppler frequency shift for a given target velocity becomes greater. These factors improve the inherent resolving power of radar in all dimensions."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-1 - Introduction to Radar \nRevised Jul 10  Page 5 of 8 the uniformity with which power is distributed in the vertical plane by a ground radar is strongly \ndependent on frequency because the number of wavelengths in the height of the aerial determines the \nnumber of interference lobes generated by ground reflection.  At metric wavelengths, large gaps in \nvertical cover may be unavoidable owing to the small number of lobes. \n11-1 Fig 1 Radar Band Characteristics \nResolution\nand precision\n    increasePower and\noperating range \n     reduceEquipment\nand weight\n   reduceInterference\n  increasesRadar\n     Bands\n(Wavelength)MetricC (50-25 cms)\nE/F (10 cms)\nI/J (3 cms)\nK (1 cm)\nAerial Parameters \n12. The function of a radar aerial during transmission is to concentrate the radiated energy into a \nshaped beam which points in the desired direction in space.  On reception, the aerial collects the \nenergy contained in the echo signal and delivers it to the receiver.  Thus, in general, the radar aerial is \ncalled upon to fulfil reciprocal but related roles.\n13. In the radar equation derived in Volume 11, Chapter 2, Para 20 et al, these two roles are \nexpressed as: \na. Transmitting Gain (G).  In a transmitting antenna, gain is the ratio of the field strength \nproduced at a point along the line of maximum radiation by a given power radiated from the \nantenna, to that produced at the same point by the same power from an omnidirectional antenna.\nb. Effective Receiving Aperture (A). The large apertures required for long-range detection \nresult in narrow beamwidths, one of the prime characteristics of radar. Narrow beamwidths are\nimportant if accurate angular measurements are to be made or if targets close to one another are \nto be resolved.  The advantage of microwave frequencies for radar application is that with \napertures of relatively small physical size, but large in terms of wavelength, narrow beamwidths \ncan be obtained conveniently.\nThe two parameters are proportional to one another.  An aerial with a large effective receiving aperture \nimplies a large transmitting gain.", "question": "What is the relationship between the transmitting gain and the effective receiving aperture of a radar aerial?", "answer": "The transmitting gain and the effective receiving aperture of a radar aerial are proportional to one another. This means that an aerial with a large effective receiving aperture implies a large transmitting gain."}, {"context": "14. The subject of microwave aerials is no longer discussed in AP 3456 and readers should research via \nother sources. \nDisplays \n15. Once the radar echo signal has been processed by the receiver the resulting information is \npresented on a visual display, in a suitable form, for operator interpretation and action.  When the \ndisplay is connected directly to the video output of the receiver, the information displayed is called \nRAW VIDEO.  This is the 'traditional' type of radar presentation.  When the receiver video is first", "question": "What is the difference between raw video and digital video in radar presentation?", "answer": "Raw video is the 'traditional' type of radar presentation where the radar echo signal is processed by the receiver and displayed directly on a visual display. On the other hand, digital video is a more modern approach where the receiver video is first processed by a computer before being displayed, resulting in more enhanced and interpreted information."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-1 - Introduction to Radar \nRevised Jul 10  Page 6 of 8 processed by an automatic detector or automatic detection and tracking processor (ADT), the output \ndisplayed is sometimes called SYNTHETIC VIDEO. \n16. The cathode-ray tube (CRT) has been almost universally used as the radar display.  There are \ntwo basic methods of indicating targets on a CRT: \na. Deflection modulation, in which the target is indicated by the deflection of the electron beam.\nAn example of this is the Type A scope (Fig 2), which plots the amplitude of a received signal \nagainst range on a horizontal line. \n11-1 Fig 2 Type A Scope Display (Deflection Modulated) \n0Target\nR A N G ENoiseSignal\nAmplitude\nb. Intensity modulation, in which the target is indicated by intensifying the electron beam and \npresenting a luminous spot on the face of the CRT.  The target thus appears brighter than the \nbackground on the screen.  An example of this is the Plan Position Indicator (PPI) (Fig 3) which \ndisplays targets in a polar plot, providing 360\u00ba of azimuth cover, centred on the radar\u2019s position.\nThe PPI can be directly correlated with the corresponding geographical map or chart. \n11-1 Fig 3 PPI Display (Intensity Modulated) \n0R\nA\nN\nG\nETargets0900\n180270\nBoth methods are capable of indicating multiple targets.", "question": "What is the difference between deflection modulation and intensity modulation in radar displays?", "answer": "Deflection modulation indicates the target by deflecting the electron beam, while intensity modulation indicates the target by intensifying the electron beam and presenting a luminous spot on the face of the CRT, making the target appear brighter than the background on the screen.

Two Dimensional Displays.  These displays are, of necessity, intensity modulated and may be \nused to display any two of the target\u2019s co-ordinates.  For special purposes, the target co-ordinates can \nbe displayed in Cartesian form, directly related to the aerial location, rather than geographical situation.  \nSome common examples are: \na. Sector PPI.  A sector of a PPI can be displayed instead of the whole 360\u00ba (Fig 4). This gives a \nrelatively undistorted picture of the region which is being scanned in azimuth.  The zero-azimuth \nindicator is normally aligned with the aircraft\u2019s heading or track.  The sector PPI display is commonly \nused for weather mapping, and in tactical aircraft for ground mapping, where the weight of the radar \nsystem and aerial size result in fewer penalties than a full PPI display.\n11-1 Fig 4 Sector PPI Display \nRANGEAzimuth\n0\nb. Type B Scope.  The Type B scope (Fig 5) shows range and bearing in Cartesian form.  In \nthis display, the zero-range point is expanded into a line along the bearing axis.  The B scope \ndisplay is commonly used in fighter aircraft, where the increase in angular resolution at short \nrange has advantages over the PPI display. \nc. Type C Scope.  The Type C scope shows target position by plotting elevation angle on the \nvertical scale against azimuth indication horizontally.  This is useful in fighter aircraft, where the \ndisplay corresponds to the pilot\u2019s view through the canopy.  The display can be projected onto a \nhead-up display.

Pulse radar will determine the location of a target by measuring its range and bearing in the \nfollowing manner: \na. Range is measured by pulse/time technique (see Volume 11, Chapter 1 Para 10a).  \nb. Bearing is measured by indication of the aerial\u2019s azimuth during its scanning movement. \n2. Fig 1 shows a block schematic diagram of a typical pulse radar system.  The functions of the \nvarious component stages are as follows:\na.Master Timer.  The master timer (sometimes referred to as the 'synchronizer') produces timing \npulses to control the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of the radar.  These timing pulses are supplied \nsynchronously to:\n(1) The modulator to trigger the transmitter operation at precise and regular instants of time. \n(2) The timebase generator of the indicator to synchronize the start of the CRT run-down \ntrace with the operation of the transmitter. \nb.Modulator. Upon receipt of each timing pulse, the modulator produces a square-formed \npulse of direct current energy to switch the transmitter on and off and so control the pulse width (\u03c4) \nof the transmitter output. \nc.Transmitter.  The transmitter is a high-power oscillator, usually a magnetron.  For the \nduration of the input pulse from the modulator, the magnetron generates a high-power radio-\nfrequency wave.  The wave is radiated into a waveguide, which carries it to the aerial. \nd. Transmit-Receive Switch.  The Transmit-Receive (TR) Switch controls the flow of radio \nwaves between transmitter, aerial and receiver. The TR switch is normally a duplexer within the\nwaveguides.  A duplexer is a passive device, sensitive to direction of flow of the radio waves.  It \nwill allow the waves from the transmitter to pass to the aerial, while blocking their flow to the \nreceiver.  Similarly, the duplexer allows the waves received at the aerial to pass to the receiver, \nwhilst blocking their way to the transmitter.", "question": "What is the role of the master timer in a pulse radar system?", "answer": "The master timer, also known as the synchronizer, produces timing pulses to control the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of the radar.

The aerial focuses the radiated energy into a beam of the required shape and \npicks up the echoes reflected from the targets.

Pulse Length.  Pulse width may also be expressed in terms of physical length.

Thus, a pulse width of 1\u03bcs equates to a pulse length of 300 metres.\n5. The Interpulse Period.  The time period between the start of one pulse and the start of the next \npulse is the interpulse period (T), also called pulse interval or pulse repetition period. \n6. The Pulse Repetition Frequency.  The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is defined as the \nnumber of pulses occurring in one second.  The interpulse period is the reciprocal of the PRF.  Thus \nfor a PRF of 500 pulses per second (pps), the interpulse pulse period is: \n) s ( onds sec micro 000 , 2 ond sec\n5001T \u00b5 = =\nIn pulse radars, the PRF normally lies between about 200 and 6,000 pps. \n7. The Radar Duty Cycle.  The ratio of the pulse width to the interpulse pulse period ( \u03c4/T) is known \nas the duty cycle.  This represents the fraction of time during which the transmitter operates.  The duty \ncycle controls the relationship between the mean power of the transmitter (upon which depends the \noperating range of the radar) and the peak pulse power.  As there is a limit to  the  peak power which \ncan be handled in a waveguide it is desirable that the duty cycle should be high.  In some cases the duty \ncycle is limited by the rating of the power source, but even when this is not the case the duty cycle cannot \nbe raised beyond limits without introducing either range ambiguity, due to excessive shortening of the \ninterpulse period T,or loss of range resolution due to excessive lengthening of the pulse width,\u03c4.\nPRF and Range Ambiguity \n8. Range ambiguity occurs if the pulse transit time to the target and back exceeds the interpulse \nperiod T.  If the PRF is made too high, the likelihood of receiving target echoes from the wrong \npulse transmission is increased. \n9.", "question": "What is the maximum unambiguous range (Rmax) in pulse radars?", "answer": "The maximum unambiguous range (Rmax) in pulse radars is given by the formula Rmax = (c \u00d7 T) / 2, where c is the velocity of propagation and T is the interpulse period."}, {"context": "9.

The echo from an unambiguous target will appear at the same place on the \ndisplay for each sweep of the time-base no matter whether the PRF is modulated or not.  However, \nechoes from multiple-time-around targets will be spread over a finite range as shown in Fig 3c.  \nInstead of modulating the PRF, other methods of 'marking' successive pulses so as to identify multiple-\ntime-around echoes could include changing the pulse amplitude, pulse width, phase, frequency or \npolarization of the transmission from pulse to pulse, but these methods are rarely used. \n11. Maximum Unambiguous Range.  To avoid range ambiguity, it is necessary to choose a value of \nT sufficiently high to permit all possible echoes from one pulse to be received before transmission of \nthe next.  The PRF used will therefore determine the maximum range at which targets can be \nmeasured without ambiguity. The maximum unambiguous range (R unamb ) can be calculated:PRF 2cRunamb\u00d7=\nFor example, a typical long range search radar may operate at a PRF of 250 pps. \nnm 324 km 600 metres1600,000metres250 20 300,000,00Runamb\n= = =\u00d7=\nA more restrictive short range target radar might operate at 1,000 pps, giving an R unamb  of 81 nm.", "question": "What is the formula for calculating the maximum unambiguous range (R unamb) in a radar system?", "answer": "The formula for calculating the maximum unambiguous range (R unamb) in a radar system is PRF 2cRunamb\u00d7=, where PRF is the Pulse Repetition Frequency, c is the speed of light, and T is the pulse width."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-2 - Pulse Radar \nRevised Jul 10  Page 5 of 9 Range Resolution \n12. If two targets are close together in range, they may merge into one target on the display.  Pulse \nlength is the fundamental factor determining the ability of a radar to resolve targets in range.  It also \nimposes a theoretical limit to the minimum range, down to which the radar can operate. \n13. If two targets are separated in range by less than half the radial distance occupied by the pulse, they are \nseen by the radar as a single echo.  Thus a radar using a pulse width of 4 microseconds (i.e. pulse length = \n1200 metres) would be able to discriminate between two targets provided they were separated in range by \nmore than 600 metres. Similarly, provided the receiver could begin to function at the instant the pulse \ntransmission ceased, the smallest range the radar could measure would be 600 metres.  In radar systems \nrequired to give high resolution, e.g. ground mapping, SAM and AI radars, pulse lengths may be in the region \nof a microsecond or less, but this is only feasible if the PRF can be high. \nReceiver Bandwidth \n14. The radio frequency (RF) in a pulse radar transmitter is generated at a spot frequency but the effect \nof pulse modulation is to cause the transmitted signal to consist of separate frequency components \nspread across a wide spectrum.  Most of the pulse energy is contained in the components which are \nclose to the basic RF, and 90% of the energy lies within a frequency band 2/\u03c4MHz wide (where\u03c4is the\npulse width in microseconds).  It follows that the shorter the pulse the more widely spread is the pulse \nenergy and the greater must be the bandwidth of the receiver in order to accept the echo pulse without \ndistortion. The bandwidth of a pulse radar receiver is normally several MHz and in this major respect it \ndiffers from a communications receiver which has a bandwidth measured in kHz. \nPulse Compression \n15. Pulse compression allows a radar to utilize a long pulse to achieve ample radiated energy, but \nsimultaneously to obtain the range resolution of a short pulse.", "question": "What is the minimum range that a radar using a pulse width of 4 microseconds can measure?", "answer": "The smallest range the radar can measure is 600 meters."}, {"context": "Pulse compression is a method of \nachieving most of the short pulse benefits outlined in para 19 while keeping within the practical \nconstraints of peak-power limitations. \n16. The degree to which the pulse is compressed is called pulse compression ratio.  It is defined as \nthe ratio of uncompressed pulse width to the compressed pulse width.  The pulse compression ratio \nmight be as small as 10 or as large as 105.  Values from 100 to 300 might be considered as more \ntypical.  There are many types of modulation used for pulse compression, but two that have wide \napplications are: \na. Linear frequency modulation. \nb. Phase-code pulse. \n17. Linear Frequency Modulation.  In this version of a pulse compression radar the transmission is \nfrequency modulated and the receiver contains a pulse compression filter.  The transmitted waveform \nconsists of a rectangular pulse of constant amplitude.  The frequency increases linearly from f 1 to f 2\nover the duration of the pulse.  On reception, the frequency-modulated echo is passed through the \npulse compression filter, which is designed so that the velocity of propagation through the filter is \nproportional to frequency.  The effect is to produce a narrow pulse output from a wide pulse input.", "question": "What is the definition of pulse compression ratio in pulse compression radar?", "answer": "The pulse compression ratio in pulse compression radar is defined as the ratio of uncompressed pulse width to the compressed pulse width."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-2 - Pulse Radar \nRevised Jul 10  Page 6 of 9 18. Phase-code Pulse.  In this form of pulse compression, a long pulse is divided into a number of \nsub-pulses. The phase of each sub-pulse is chosen to be either 0 or\u03c0radians. The choice of phase\nfor each sub-pulse may be set out as code. \nApplication of Short Pulses \n19. The radar may require short pulse widths for the following purposes: \na. Range Resolution.  It is usually easier to separate targets in the range co-ordinate than in angle. \nb. Range Accuracy.  If a radar is capable of good range resolution it is also capable of good \nrange accuracy. \nc.Clutter Reduction.A short pulse increases the target to clutter ratio by reducing the clutter\ncontained in the resolution cell with which the target competes. \nd. Glint Reduction.  In a tracking radar, the angle and tracking errors introduced by a finite size \ntarget are reduced by increased range resolution since it permits individual scattering centres to \nbe resolved. \ne. Multipath Resolution. Sufficient range resolution permits the separation of the desired \ntarget echo from echoes that arrive via scattering from longer paths, or multipath. \nf. Minimum Range.  A short pulse width allows a radar to operate with a short minimum range. \ng. Target Classification.  The characteristic echo signal from a target when observed by a \nshort pulse can be used to distinguish one class of target from another. \nh. Electronic Protective Measures.  A short pulse radar can negate the operation of certain \nelectronic counter measures (ECM) such as range gate stealers and repeater jammers, if the \nresponse time of the ECM is greater than the radar pulse duration.  The wide bandwidth of a short \npulse radar also has some advantage against noise jammers. \nThe Radar Equation \n20. The radar equation provides the basis for analysing radar system performance, and in its \nfundamental form it expresses the echo signal power (S) as a function of the system and target \nparameters: \nwatts A2R 42R 4G PS\u00d7\n\u03c0\u03c3\u00d7\n\u03c0=\n21.", "question": "What is the purpose of using short pulse widths in a radar system?", "answer": "The purpose of using short pulse widths in a radar system includes: improving range resolution, enhancing range accuracy, reducing clutter, minimizing glint in tracking radar, resolving multipath echoes, enabling shorter minimum range, aiding in target classification, and providing electronic protective measures against certain electronic countermeasures."}, {"context": "Fig 4 illustrates the composition of the first group of terms: \n2R 4G P\n\u03c0\nwhich represents the power density in the transmitted wavefront as it passes over the target.", "question": "What does the term 2R represent in the power density of the transmitted wavefront?", "answer": "The term 2R represents the power density of the reflected wavefront in the power density of the transmitted wavefront."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-2 - Pulse Radar \nRevised Jul 10  Page 7 of 9 11-2 Fig 4 Power Density of Transmitted Wavefront \nT\nRP watts\nAeTransmitted\nWavefront\nTarget R\nPower Density =P G\n4 R\u03c0\nWithin the term, the radar pulse peak power P (in watts) is multiplied by the transmitting gain of the\naerial G, and then divided by the surface area of a sphere of radius R (metres). \n22.

The following observations need to be made on the parameters used in the radar equation: \na. Power.  Detection range depends on the fourth root of transmitted peak power.  Doubling the \npower therefore increases range by 42 (that is, by only 19%), while to double range it is \nnecessary to raise the power by 24, ie 16 times. \nb.Aerial.For long range operation the radiated energy must be concentrated into a narrow beam\nfor high aerial gain and the received echo must be collected with a large aerial aperture (synonymous \nwith high gain). However, for airborne systems, the increase in aerial size may be unacceptable. \nc.Wavelength.  Wavelength does not directly influence detection range except in the sense that it \ndetermines the aerial gain for a given area, or conversely, the area required for a given gain.  Indirectly, \nhowever, wavelength has a considerable bearing on the matter because it sets an upper limit to the\npeak power which can be handled. The smaller the wavelength, the smaller the peak power. \nd. Minimum Detectable Signal.  The size of the minimum detectable signal depends on a \nnumber of factors, of which the following are the most important: \n(1) Receiver Noise.  The greater the noise in the receiver, the greater must be the signal \nfor a given probability of detection. \n(2) Scanning Parameters.", "question": "What is the relationship between the aerial gain and the aerial area in a radar system?", "answer": "The aerial gain is directly proportional to the aerial area in a radar system, assuming all other factors remain constant. This means that a larger aerial area will result in a higher aerial gain, and vice versa. However, for airborne systems, the increase in aerial size may be unacceptable due to practical constraints."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-2 - Pulse Radar \nRevised Jul 10  Page 9 of 9 energy back towards the radar, but if slightly inclined from the right angle most of the energy would be \nreflected away from the radar.  Thus for practically no change in the true cross-sectional area the echo \nsignal would change drastically.  In order to describe the reflective properties of targets it is necessary to \nadopt a fictitious quantity called echoing area (\u03c3). For a particular aspect of a target it is the cross-\nsectional area it would need to have in order to account for its echo signal, assuming it to re-radiate \nisotropically.  The echoing area of aircraft targets may vary with aspect over very wide limits and give \ndifferences in echo power of as much as 40 to 1 for as little as 0.3\u00ba change of aspect.  Since the aspect \nof a target is continually changing with respect to the radar, partly due to changing position and partly to \nflight oscillations and vibrations, the echo signal may fluctuate at some characteristic period or \ncombination of periods. \n25. Modifications of the Radar Equation. The simple radar equation discussed above does not \npredict the full range performance of actual radar equipments to a satisfactory degree of accuracy.  It \nassumes free space propagation and takes no account of the effects of ground reflection, atmospheric \nrefraction, absorption or diffraction around the Earth\u2019s surface.  It also fails to take into account the \nvarious losses that can occur throughout the system.  It is possible to develop a more complex form of \nthe radar equation to include these and other factors which influence radar range performance.  The \nsimple equation, which is applicable to pulse systems, may also be modified to cover the operation of \nany radar system (CW, FMCW, Pulse Doppler, Secondary, Semi-active etc).  A more detailed study of \nthe radar equation is, however, outside the scope of this chapter.", "question": "What is the echoing area (\u03c3) in the context of radar?", "answer": "In the context of radar, echoing area (\u03c3) is a fictitious quantity used to describe the reflective properties of targets.

In theory the maximum range at which a target can be detected by radar could be extended \nalmost indefinitely by adding more and more amplifier stages to the receiver.  The existence of \nbackground noise, both man-made and natural, prevents this in practice, since a stage is reached at \nwhich the level of signal falls below the background noise level and becomes obscured by it.  If the \nreceiver gain is increased, both signal and noise are amplified equally. \n2. Another limiting factor on the performance of a radar receiver is the presence of clutter.  Clutter \nmay be defined as any unwanted radar echo.  Its name is descriptive of the fact that such echoes can \n'clutter' the radar output and make it difficult to detect wanted targets.  Examples of unwanted echoes \ninclude the reflections from land, sea, rain, birds, insects and chaff. \n3. This chapter deals with some of the devices and techniques used in radar to limit the effect of noise \nand clutter on receiver performance.  These devices range from such simple circuit refinements as swept \ngain to more complex systems such as Moving Target Indication, Pulse Integration and Constant False \nAlarm Rate receivers. \nCLUTTER \nCircuit Refinements \n4. Modifications and additions that can be made to the circuits of a normal radar receiver in an \nattempt to reduce clutter include the following: \na. Swept Gain.  Clutter is worst at short ranges and diminishes along the time base.  The \nswept gain control makes use of this fact and causes the receiver gain to be lowered at the \ncommencement of the time base as each pulse is fired, and thereafter increases the gain \nexponentially with time.  In this way, saturation of the receiver is avoided without the elimination \nof weaker signals from more distant ranges.  In American terminology this facility is called \nSensitivity Time Control.  (Not to be confused with Fast or Short Time Constant-see para 4b.)", "question": "What is the purpose of the swept gain control in a radar receiver?", "answer": "The swept gain control in a radar receiver is designed to lower the receiver gain at the commencement of the time base as each pulse is fired, and then increase the gain exponentially with time. This helps avoid saturation of the receiver without eliminating weaker signals from more distant ranges, as clutter is typically worse at short ranges and diminishes along the time base."}, {"context": "b. Fast (or Short) Time Constant (FTC), (STC).  A differentiating circuit which only has an \noutput when there are increases in the level of incoming signals.  As a result, only the leading \nedges of long pulses are displayed. \nc. Instantaneous Automatic Gain Control (IAGC).  A fast-acting AGC circuit which lowers \nthe receiver gain two or three pulse lengths after receipt of an incoming signal.  Short pulses are \ntherefore unaffected and only the leading edges of long pulses are displayed. \nd.Pulse length Discrimination. Echo signals from wanted targets are rarely of greater \nduration than a pulse length or so and this provides a basis for rejecting a large proportion of clutter \nsignals, the majority of which are of considerable duration.  Certain types of jamming may also be \nattenuated in this way.  A number of anti-clutter devices discriminate on the basis of pulse length, \nalthough they may differ considerably in detail, complexity and effectiveness.  The main difficulty is \nthat wanted signals of short duration occurring within the period of a rejected pulse must still be \ndisplayed.  By the use of storage techniques all incoming signals are delayed sufficiently before", "question": "What is Instantaneous Automatic Gain Control (IAGC) and how does it affect the display of pulses?", "answer": "Instantaneous Automatic Gain Control (IAGC) is a fast-acting AGC circuit that lowers the receiver gain two or three pulse lengths after receipt of an incoming signal. This means that short pulses are unaffected, but only the leading edges of long pulses are displayed."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-3 - Anti-Clutter Noise Techniques \nRevised Jul 10  Page 2 of 6 display to permit their lengths to be measured.  Those exceeding a few pulse lengths are totally \nsuppressed. \ne. Pulse Interference Suppression.  This device operates on the incoming signals in such a \nway that only those occurring at the transmitter repetition frequency are passed to the display.  It \nis, therefore, effective against interference from other radars operating at different PRFs and to \nnon-synchronous pulse jamming. \nf. Dicke Fix.  This is a technique that is designed to protect the receiver from fast sweep noise \njamming.  It consists of a broad-band limiting IF amplifier followed by an IF amplifier of optimum \nsignal bandwidth for the known transmitted frequency.  The wide band amplifier amplifies both the \nnoise and the signal.  The limiter which follows cuts the peak noise amplitude associated with the \nsignal, with the following narrow band amplifier limiting the bandwidth to that of the signal, thus \nfurther excluding the unwanted noise (Fig 1).  The reduction in noise/jamming that can be \nachieved is in the order of 20 to 40 dB (1\n1001\n10 000th to th,). \n11-3 Fig 1 Dicke Fix Receiver \nSignal + NoiseWide\nBand\nAmpNoise\nLimiterNarrow\nBand\nAmpMaximum\nSignal/Noise\nRatio\nNoise\nSignalf f ffLogarithmic Amplifiers \n5. The normal radar receiver has a linear response, its output being proportional to the received \nsignal level.  Once the limit of the output is achieved, further increases in the input can have no effect \nand the receiver is said to be saturated.  Saturation can be brought about by strong responses from \nPEs, cloud and many types of jamming.  Under these conditions wanted signals may either be \nswamped, or, if the receiver gain is lowered in an attempt to accommodate the large signals, the \nwanted signals may fall below the visibility threshold.  An alternative receiver which may be used in \nthese circumstances is one having an amplifier giving a logarithmic response, the output being \nproportional to the log of the input amplitude.", "question": "What is the Dicke Fix technique designed to protect the receiver from?", "answer": "The Dicke Fix technique is designed to protect the receiver from fast sweep noise jamming."}, {"context": "This makes it possible to receive even the strongest \nsignals without saturation and it is an effective way of countering clutter and certain types of jamming.  \nBecause the logarithmic receiver amplifies small signals more than large ones it has the effect of \nreducing the signal to noise ratio and so reduces the detection range of the radar.  (But this is a small \nprice to pay for the ability to see through clutter.)", "question": "What is the effect of a logarithmic receiver on the signal to noise ratio?", "answer": "The effect of a logarithmic receiver on the signal to noise ratio is that it reduces it, which in turn reduces the detection range of the radar."}, {"context": "As the frequency of echoes from moving targets is shifted by the \nDoppler effect, this provides a powerful basis for distinguishing between wanted and unwanted \ntargets.  To recognize echoes containing a frequency shift, a coherent frequency reference must be \nestablished in the radar.  When incoming signals are mixed with this reference, the components from \nmoving targets vary in amplitude from pulse to pulse at the Doppler frequency corresponding to the \nrelative velocity of the target.  The components of the incoming signals returned from fixed targets do \nnot vary in frequency.  By feeding signals which are the algebraic difference of the outputs from \nsuccessive pulses to the display, the fixed echo components cancel, whereas the moving echo \ncomponents always leave a residual signal.  This is achieved by dividing the receiver output into two \nchannels.  In one channel the signals are delayed for an interval equal to the pulse period.  The lines \nre-unite at a subtraction unit, the output being the difference between two successive trains of pulses. \n8. Application of MTI.  The effectiveness of MTI increases with the number of pulses-per-scan and it \nis therefore more worthwhile to apply MTI to a broad beamed radar than to a narrow one.  The \neffectiveness may also be increased by employing double or triple cancellation, the cancellation circuits \nbeing connected in series.  Yet another method is to eliminate the possibility of mis-match between the \npulse period and delay line interval by using the latter to control the PRF.  A refinement which may \nsometimes be added is the means of applying Doppler compensation to selected areas of a PPI display \nso as to attenuate returns from moving clouds or rain storms.  (When this is done, fixed echoes within \nthe compensated area will re-appear.) The same device is effective against moving 'Chaff' clouds. \n9. Blind Speeds.  A disadvantage of MTI radars is the existence of blind speeds.  When the \ncomponent of a target\u2019s velocity towards or away from the radar is equal to either zero, half \n(wavelength \u00d7PRF) or any multiple of that speed, the signals returned from it will not vary from pulse", "question": "What is the effect of the Doppler effect on the frequency of echoes from moving targets in MTI radar?", "answer": "The Doppler effect causes a frequency shift in the echoes from moving targets, which provides a basis for distinguishing between wanted and unwanted targets in MTI radar.

Airborne MTI.  MTI has possible applications in airborne early warning, ASW radars, \nreconnaissance radars and AI.  The broad principles of airborne MTI do not differ from those \ndescribed but the methods of implementation may vary considerably.  In order to be able to see \ntargets which move with respect to the Earth it is first necessary to compensate for the velocity of\nthe radar carrier.  This requires a false Doppler shift in the reference signal proportional to the \ncomponent of aircraft velocity along the radar beam.  If it is a scanning beam the compensation \nmust be continually changing. \nNOISE \nFalse Alarm Rates \n11. Whenever the noise level envelope of a receiver exceeds the receiver threshold, a target \ndetection is considered to have taken place, by definition (see Fig 3).", "question": "What is the relationship between blind speed and unambiguous range in MTI radar?", "answer": "The relationship between blind speed and unambiguous range in MTI radar is that as the blind speed increases, the unambiguous range decreases, and this relationship is more pronounced with shorter wavelengths. This is depicted in Figure 2, which shows the first MTI blind speed as a function of unambiguous range for representative wavelengths."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-3 - Anti-Clutter Noise Techniques \nRevised Jul 10  Page 5 of 6 11-3 Fig 3 False Alarms Due to Noise \nTimeThreshold\nVoltageRms Noise\nVoltageThresholdEnvelope ofNoise (Volts)\nVT\n12. The average time between false alarms, and therefore the rate, is a function of: \na. The threshold level voltage. \nb. The receiver bandwidth. \nc. The root-mean-square (rms) noise voltage. \nThat is to say, increases in threshold voltage reduce the rate and increases in bandwidth and noise \nvoltage increase the rate. These relationships are depicted in the graphs shown in Fig 4.\n11-3 Fig 4 Average Time Between False Alarms \n3 days\n2 days\n1 day\n12 h\n1 h\n15 min100\n1\n0.110\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\nThreshold-to-Noise RatioAverageTime BetweenFalseAlarms\n10Hz\n100Hz\n1kHz\n1MHz1Hz\n(Hours)\n10kHz\n100kHz\n10MHz\nConstant False Alarm Rate (Receivers) \n13. The false alarm rate is quite sensitive to receiver threshold voltage level.  For example, a 1dB \nchange in threshold can result in three orders of magnitude change in false alarm probability.  It does \nnot take much of a drift in receiver gain, a change in receiver noise, or the presence of external noise \nor clutter echoes to inundate the radar display with extraneous responses. \n14. If the changes in false alarm rate are gradual, an operator viewing a display can compensate with \nmanual gain adjustment.  It is said that the maximum increase in noise level that can be tolerated with", "question": "What is the effect of a 1dB change in threshold on false alarm probability?", "answer": "A 1dB change in threshold can result in three orders of magnitude change in false alarm probability."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-3 - Anti-Clutter Noise Techniques \nRevised Jul 10  Page 6 of 6 a manual system using displays is between 5 dBs and 10 dBs.  But with an automatic detection and \ntracking system, the tolerable increase is less than l dB.  Excessive false alarms in an ADT system \ncause the computer to overload as it attempts to associate false alarms with established tracks or to \ngenerate new, but false, tracks.  Manual control is too slow and imprecise for automatic systems.  \nSome automatic, instantaneous means is required to maintain a constant false alarm rate.  Devices \nthat accomplish this purpose are called CFAR. \nPulse Integration \n15. The number of pulses returned from a point target as a radar aerial scans through its beam width \nis a function of the aerial beam width, the scanning rate and PRF.  Typical parameters for a ground-\nbased search radar might be a PRF of 300 Hz, 1.5\u00ba beam width, and a scan rate of 5 rpm.  These \nparameters result in 15 hits from a point target per scan.  By summing these returns through a process \nof integration the signal/noise ratio, and therefore the detection, can be improved.  All practical \nintegration techniques use some sort of storage device. \n16. Integration may be accomplished in a radar receiver either before the second detector (in the IF) \nor after the second detector (in the video).  Integration before the detector is called pre-detection, or \ncoherent integration, while integration after the detector is called post detection, or noncoherent \nintegration.  If n pulses, all of the same amplitude would be integrated by an ideal pre-detection \nintegrator, the resultant signal/noise ratio would be exactly n times that of a single pulse.  If the same n \npulses were integrated by an ideal post detection device, the resultant signal/noise ratio would be less \nthan n times that of a single pulse.

A pulse transmission gives the inherent ability to measure range, permits the use of a single aerial and \neliminates the possibility that transmitter noise will interfere with the detection of weak echo signals.  The \ndisadvantages are the breadth of the transmitted spectrum, which necessitates a large receiver bandwidth, \nthe finite minimum range, and the need to handle high peak powers in order to achieve the required mean \npower. \n2. In continuous wave radar, the transmitted spectrum is a single frequency and the receiver \nbandwidth may therefore be very narrow.  Moreover, as the duty cycle is unity, the mean power can be \nas high as the available transmitter will permit.  The absence of timing marks in the transmission of a \npure CW radar means that the ability to measure range is lost but in place of this the coherence of the \ntransmission makes it possible to exploit the Doppler shift in the echo signal to resolve target velocity.  \nUnlike pulse radar, the transmitter is never silent, and except at very low power levels where single \naerial CW working is possible, it is necessary to employ separate aerials for transmission and \nreception in order to isolate the receiver from the transmitter. \nPure CW Radar \n3. In a pure CW radar, both the transmitted and received signals consist (for practical reasons) of a \nsingle frequency component, but if there is relative velocity between the target and radar, the echo signal \nwill differ in frequency from the transmitted signal due to the Doppler effect.

In airborne \napplications, CW is used for doppler navigation and rate-of-climb in VTOL aircraft. \nFrequency Modulated CW Radar \n9. If timing marks are introduced into the transmission of a CW radar by modulating the frequency it \nbecomes possible to measure range, but accuracy comparable to pulse radar ranging is only possible \nover very short distances. Radio altimeters employing FMCW transmissions are a familiar example of\nthis technique applied over distances of up to 5,000 feet or so.  In many radar applications it is \nsufficient to be able to obtain an approximate target range, eg in order to establish when a target \ncomes within the launch range of a missile.  For such applications, an FMCW radar may be used. \n10. A common form of transmission for an FMCW radar is shown in Fig 5. The frequency of the \ntransmitted signal (represented by the full line in the upper diagram) is swept linearly with time back and \nforth over the band B.  An echo signal (represented by the broken line) received from a stationary target at \nrange R will be of exactly similar form but displaced in time by the interval 2R/C. The difference frequency\nfR between the transmitted and received signals can be measured and is proportional to the time interval \n2R/C and hence to the target range. This is the basis of the FMCW ranging technique. \n11-4 Fig 5 Range Measurement of a Stationary Target \nTime\nfRB2RCT\nFrequency\nDifference\nFrequencyfR\n11. In the more general case of a moving target the echo signal still has the same form as the \ntransmitted signal but, in addition to being displaced in time, it is also displaced in frequency by the\nDoppler shift f d.

Ranging Accuracy.  Ranging accuracy in an FMCW radar is a function of the rate of change of \nfrequency in the transmitted signal which, as can be seen from Fig 5, must be high in order to produce \na large change in the difference frequency fR for a corresponding increment in range.

The FMCW radar principle is used in the aircraft low-level radio altimeter to measure height above \nthe surface of the earth.  The relatively short ranges required permit low transmitter power and low \naerial gain.  Since the relative motion between the aircraft and ground is small, the effect of the \nDoppler frequency shift may usually be neglected.\n14. The absolute accuracy of radar altimeters is usually of more importance at very low altitudes than at \nhigh altitudes.  Errors of a few feet might not be significant when operating at 4,000 feet, but are important \nif the altimeter is part of a blind landing system. Errors can be introduced into the system if there are\nuncontrolled variations in the transmitter frequency and modulation frequency.  Multipath signals also \nproduce errors.

Pulse Doppler radar is an attempt to combine, in a single system, the attributes of both pulse and \nCW radars.  It employs a coherent, pulsed transmission of high duty cycle, sometimes described as \ninterrupted CW, which gives it the ability to resolve both range and velocity.  Unfortunately, however, \nthere is an inherent incompatibility between the two processes which makes it impossible to avoid \nambiguity in both range and velocity at the same time, and the successful implementation of the \nprinciple hinges on how effectively this incompatibility can be resolved. \n2. A Moving Target Indicator (MTI) radar, which in the broadest sense is a form of pulse Doppler \nradar, normally operates at a sufficiently low PRF to avoid range ambiguity, and, as a result, suffers \nfrom blind speeds within the velocity range of interest.  If the Doppler shift could be measured, it would \nbe found to correspond to any one of a number of possible target speeds, separated from one another \nby half the interval between the blind speeds.  In other words, the velocity resolution would be \nambiguous.  In the true pulse Doppler radar, the reverse situation applies.  In this case, the PRF is \nnormally high enough to avoid blind and ambiguous velocities, but, as a consequence, it suffers from \nboth blind and ambiguous ranges.  A blind range occurs whenever the pulse transit time is such that \nthe echo arrives back during the transmission of a pulse, and, under these conditions, the radar cannot \nbe aware of the existence of the target.  There are a number of possible ways in which the blind ranges \nmay be alleviated and the ambiguity resolved. \n3.

On the other hand, an MTI radar uses two aerials, one for transmission and the other for reception, with the transmitted pulse not split but used as a reference for the received pulse. The received pulse in an MTI radar is mixed with the transmitted pulse to produce a beat frequency, which is then fed to the video detector."}, {"context": "The pulses may be of comparable length to those used in an \nequivalent pulse radar, but the PRF is many times greater and permits a high duty cycle which may well \napproach \u00bd, ie pulse length equal to separation time.  This fact means that it possesses the attribute of  \nthe CW radar and that it can utilize high mean power without the problem of handling high peak power \nwhich occurs in pulse radar.  The Doppler information is obtained by beating the echo signal with a \nsample of the transmitter oscillator signal, and velocity resolution is performed by means of filters.  The \nresolution of range, which is fundamentally a timing process, may be performed in one of several ways \nand depends mainly on the method used to sort out the ambiguities.  To appreciate the extent of the latter \nproblem it is necessary to examine the overall question of ambiguity in greater detail. \nRange and Velocity Ambiguity \n4. The maximum range which can be measured without ambiguity in a pulse radar is discussed in\nVolume 11, Chapter 2.  The equation to calculate it is: \nPRF 2cRunamb\u00d7=\nExamination of this equation shows that, for a given time interval measured between a returning radar \necho and the preceding transmitted pulse, the corresponding target range could be any one of a\nnumber of possible target ranges separated from one another by the distance c/(2 \u00d7 PRF). \n5. There is no equivalent to this situation in a pure CW radar which can, theoretically, measure \nunlimited velocity.  However, in a pulse Doppler radar, velocity ambiguity occurs because the \ntransmitted spectrum, unlike that of a pure CW transmission, consists of a number of discrete \nfrequency components centred on the carrier frequency and separated from one another by the PRF.\nAs a Doppler shift affects all components alike, the echo pulse consists of an exactly similar spectrum \nin which all components have been translated to a higher or lower frequency by the extent of the", "question": "What is the maximum range that can be measured without ambiguity in a pulse radar?", "answer": "The maximum range which can be measured without ambiguity in a pulse radar is calculated using the equation: PRF 2cRunamb\u00d7=, where PRF is the pulse repetition frequency, c is the speed of light, and Runamb is the unambiguous range."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-5 - Pulse Doppler Radar and MTI \nRevised Jul 10  Page 2 of 4 Doppler shift.  If the Doppler frequency is detected by beating the echo spectrum with a pure CW \nsignal from the master oscillator, the result is the same whether the shift is positive or negative, and \nthe highest fundamental beat frequency which can be produced is that which occurs whenever the\nreference frequency lies mid-way between two of the components of the echo spectrum.  In other \nwords, velocity measurement will become ambiguous if the Doppler frequency shift (2V/\u03bb) is more than \nhalf the PRF.  The avoidance of this situation requires that the operating PRF should be at least twice \nthe highest Doppler frequency which the system must be capable of measuring.\n6.

This technique is based on the fact that the Doppler frequency shift of a moving target is proportional to its radial velocity.

The filter is designed to have a cut-off frequency equal to the maximum Doppler frequency shift which the system must be capable of measuring.

The blind speeds of two independent radars operating at the same frequency will be different if \ntheir pulse repetition frequencies are different. Therefore, if one radar was 'blind' to moving targets, it\nwould be unlikely that the other radar would be blind also.  Instead of using two separate radars, the \nsame result can be obtained with one radar which 'time-shares' its pulse repetition frequency between \ntwo or more different values (multiple PRFs).  The pulse repetition frequency might be switched every \nother scan or every time the aerial has scanned a half beamwidth, or the period might be alternated on\nevery other pulse.

Tracking radars are used in applications demanding a continuous flow of target data concerning \ndiscrete targets.  Such a requirement exists in such functions as ballistic missile and satellite tracking, and \nin active and semi-active guidance from ground-to-air, air-to-air, and air-to-ground. Even when an\noperator is involved, as in AI radar, it may be advantageous to employ a radar which is able to follow a \nselected target automatically. \n2. The data flow from a tracking radar consists of angle and range information in the case of a pulse\nradar, and angle and velocity in the case of a CW radar.  Angle tracking is performed by slaving the aerial \nto follow the selected target, the echo signals from which are processed so as to provide the controlling \nsignals for the steering servo-motors, and the angle information is derived from the aerial direction.  \nRange tracking is achieved by causing an electronic switching circuit, called a range gate, to operate in\nsynchronism with the arrival of echo pulses from the selected target.  The range information is taken from \nthe signal controlling the time of opening of the gate in the pulse cycle.  Velocity tracking is carried out by \nmeans of a tuneable oscillator which is constrained to oscillate at a frequency bearing a fixed relationship \nto that of the selected Doppler echo signal. The velocity information is obtained from the signal controlling\nthe oscillator frequency. \n3. Before it can track, the tracking radar must first acquire its target.  The initial search may be \nperformed by a separate radar which determines the target\u2019s coordinates with sufficient accuracy to put\nthe tracking radar on to it, or the tracking radar may perform its own search by operating in a scanning \nmode.  Neither arrangement is ideal, the former because of its inconvenience and complication \n(particularly in an airborne system) and the latter because the narrow pencil beam required to track in \ntwo coordinates is unsuitable for searching a large angular volume.\nAngle Tracking \n4.", "question": "What is the method used for angle tracking in a tracking radar?", "answer": "Angle tracking in a tracking radar is performed by slaving the aerial to follow the selected target.

The angle-tracking circuit compares the angle of arrival of the echo signals with the commanded angle of the aerial and generates an error signal which is used to control the servo-mechanism."}, {"context": "Angle Tracking \n4. In order to track a target in two angular coordinates, as defined by the aerial steering axes, error\nsignals must be generated proportional to the two components of its angular displacement from the \ntracking axis. These signals may then be used to activate the corresponding steering servos so as to \ndrive the tracking axis into coincidence with the line to the target.  The required signals may either be \ngenerated sequentially by conical scanning or sequential lobing techniques, or they may be obtained\nsimultaneously by the monopulsing technique. \n5. Conical Scanning.  In conical scanning, the beam axis is displaced through a small angle from \nthe tracking axis and is rotated in such a fashion that it describes a cone, as depicted in Fig 1.  The \neffect may be produced by rotating an offset feed in a concentric reflector, in which case the plane of \npolarization rotates with the beam; or by wobbling the reflector behind a stationary feed, in which case\nthe polarization is unaffected.  In the direction of the rotation axis (A in the figure) the gain of the beam \nis constant irrespective of its position, but in any other direction the gain of the beam varies as the \nbeam rotates.  Thus, a target which does not lie in the direction of the tracking axis, for example in the \ndirections B or C, will give rise to echo signals which vary in amplitude within the corresponding\nenvelopes shown in the lower part of the figure.  The amplitude of the echo modulation is proportional \nto the displacement of the target from the tracking axis, and the sense of the displacement, and is \ndetermined by relating the phase of the modulation to a reference signal, shown in the centre of the \nfigure, generated by the beam rotating mechanism.

This can be achieved by rotating an offset feed in a concentric reflector or by wobbling the reflector behind a stationary feed. The gain of the beam remains constant in the direction of the rotation axis, but varies in any other direction. If the target does not lie in the direction of the tracking axis, it will give rise to echo signals that vary in amplitude within specific envelopes. The amplitude of the echo modulation is proportional to the displacement of the target from the tracking axis, and the sense of the displacement is determined by relating the phase of the modulation to a reference signal.

Sequential Lobing.  Sequential lobing is a less common technique in which the beam is \ngenerated sequentially in each of four directions symmetrically disposed about the tracking axis, as \nshown in Fig 2.  The effect may be produced by means of a single reflector and four offset feeds to \nwhich the receiver is connected in sequence. The transmission may also take place sequentially or it\nmay be made in all four beams simultaneously.  Fig 3 illustrates the principle applied in a single \ncoordinate.  As in conical scanning, the echo from a target not lying on the tracking axis varies from \nbeam to beam and may be processed in a similar fashion to obtain the error signal needed to drive the \naerial into coincidence with the target. The reference signal in this case is taken from the beam-\nswitching device and each opposite pair of beams is placed in the plane of an aerial steering axis. \n11-6 Fig 2 Beam Configuration for Sequential Lobing and Monopulsing \nAntennaTracking\nPoint", "question": "What is the technique used in sequential lobing to generate the beam in four directions?", "answer": "The technique used in sequential lobing to generate the beam in four directions is by means of a single reflector and four offset feeds to which the receiver is connected in sequence."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-6 - Tracking Radar \nRevised Jul 10  Page 3 of 7 11-6 Fig 3 Sequential Lobing \nAngleSwitching Axis\nTarget\nRectangularRepresentationPolar\nRepresentationTarget\nLobe 1 Lobe 2\nLobe 1 Signal Lobe 2 SignalError SignalTime\nAmplitude\n7. Both conical scanning and sequential lobing systems suffer from the limitation that any modulation \nin the echo signal occurring during the scanning cycle will cause false signals to be passed to the \nsteering servos.  This can arise because of signal amplitude changes due to changes of target aspect, \nand if this modulation coincides with a harmonic of the scanning frequency, may cause the tracking \nsystem to unlock.  The same effect can be produced by a form of repeater jammer which senses the \nscanning rate and sends back false echoes, amplitude modulated at the scanning rate, which may \ncause the aerial to be steered away from the target.  The susceptibility of conical scanning and \nsequential lobing systems to this defect may be reduced by employing variable PRF in a pulse radar, \nor variable scanning rate in either pulse or CW radars. \n8. Monopulse Tracking.  Monopulse tracking, also called simultaneous lobing, is achieved by a \nsimilar beam configuration to that used in sequential lobing, but with the important difference that both \ntransmission and reception take place in all four beams simultaneously.  The error signals, proportional \nto the differences in the outputs of opposite beams, are derived directly by suitable waveguide \nconnections at the aerial.  As these signals are generated with each successive pulse (or continuously \nin a CW radar) the monopulse system is not susceptible to the effects of amplitude fluctuation due to \ntarget aspect changes or deceptive repeater jamming.  Further, since all the tracking information is \ngained from one pulse as compared with four pulses for a typical sequential lobe system, the data rate \nfor a monopulse system is higher. \nRange Tracking \n9.", "question": "What is the difference between sequential lobing and monopulse tracking?", "answer": "While both sequential lobing and monopulse tracking use similar beam configurations, the key difference lies in the timing of transmission and reception. In sequential lobing, transmission and reception occur in each beam sequentially, with error signals derived from the differences in the outputs of opposite beams. On the other hand, monopulse tracking involves simultaneous transmission and reception in all four beams. This simultaneous operation in monopulse tracking makes it resistant to amplitude fluctuation due to target aspect changes or deceptive repeater jamming, and it provides tracking information from one pulse, resulting in a higher data rate compared to sequential lobing."}, {"context": "Range Tracking \n9.

Such \nscanning rates can only be achieved by electronic or electro-mechanical means and, depending on the \nangular coverage, it may also be necessary to employ a multiplicity of beams. \n14.

High speed scanning is achieved by controlling the relative phase of the \nradiated signal across the aerial aperture in such a way that the wave front is inclined from the parallel.  \nThe total angle through which the beam can be steered is less than 180\u00ba.

Doppler navigation radar is an airborne radar which relies on the Doppler effect to determine the \naircraft\u2019s ground speed and drift.  The values may be continuously displayed, or transmitted to other \nequipment such as a navigation computer. \nThe Doppler Effect \n2. The Doppler effect describes the apparent change in pitch that occurs when a sound source is \nmoving relative to an observer.  The same effect occurs with electromagnetic waves.  \n3. Fig 1 shows a stationary transmitter transmitting a signal of f Hz towards a stationary receiver, the \ncircles representing successive wavefronts.  Providing that the medium of transmission is \nhomogeneous, the wavefronts will be equally spaced and the receiver will detect a frequency identical \nto that transmitted. \n11-7 Fig 1 Stationary Transmitter and Receiver \nRx Tx\n4. Fig 2 shows the situation where the transmitter is moving towards the receiver at a velocity of V m/s.  \nThe first wavefront is centred on position 1, the second on position 2 and so on.  The overall effect is to \ndecrease the wavefront spacing in front of the transmitter, which will appear to the receiver as an increase \nin the received frequency. Behind the transmitter the wavefront spacing is increased and so a receiver\nplaced there would experience a reduced frequency. \n11-7 Fig 2 Transmitter Moving Successive Wave-Fronts \nRx Tx \u2192\n1 2 3 4", "question": "What is the Doppler effect and how does it affect the wavefront spacing?", "answer": "The Doppler effect is a phenomenon that describes the apparent change in pitch or frequency of a sound or electromagnetic wave when the source is moving relative to an observer. When a transmitter is moving towards a receiver, as in Figure 2, the wavefront spacing in front of the transmitter decreases. This appears to the receiver as an increase in the received frequency. Conversely, behind the transmitter, the wavefront spacing increases, resulting in a reduced frequency for a receiver placed there."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-7 - Doppler Navigation Radar \nRevised Jun 10  Page 2 of 13 5. The change in frequency, known as the Doppler shift (f d), is proportional to the transmitter\u2019s \nvelocity such that: \ncVffd=\nwhere c is the speed of propagation of the electromagnetic waves (approx 3 \u00d7 108 m/s for radio waves \nin air).  Since the transmitted frequency, f, and wavelength, \u03bb, are related by: \n\u03bb= c/f \nfd may be written as V/\u03bb. \n6. The same Doppler shift is apparent with a stationary source and a moving receiver.  In the case \nof an airborne radar, the transmitter and receiver are collocated and the radar energy is reflected by \nthe ground. When the energy reaches the ground from the moving transmitter it undergoes a\nDoppler shift to produce a frequency of (f + Vf/c) and it is this frequency which is reflected back to \nthe aircraft.  The situation is now that of a stationary transmitter (the ground) and a moving receiver \nwhich therefore detects a further Doppler shift of Vf/c.  Thus compared to the transmitted frequency, \nf, the receiver detects a total frequency change of 2Vf/c. Since both f and c are known, if the\nchange in frequency can be measured a value for V can be determined and it is this principle which \nis used in Doppler navigation radars to determine groundspeed.  \nDoppler Measurement of Groundspeed \n7. Fig 3 illustrates the general principle of groundspeed measurement in which a narrow radar beam \nis transmitted forwards and downwards from the aircraft at an angle,\u03b8, called the depression angle. In\nthis situation, the difference in frequency between the transmitted signal and the echo received from\nthe ground will be \u03b8coscVf 2, where V is the aircraft groundspeed. \n11-7 Fig 3 Principle of Doppler Groundspeed Measurement \nEchoesDepression\nAngle \u03b8\nTx Pulses\nScattered EnergySurface8.

Operating Frequency.  The Doppler frequency to be measured, f d, equates to about 34 Hz per \n100 MHz of transmitter frequency per 100 knots, multiplied by the cosine of the depression angle.  \nSince this represents a very small proportion of the transmitted frequency, it is necessary for this to \nbe high in order to obtain a value for f d which can be measured with sufficient accuracy.  In practice, \ntwo frequency bands have been allocated to Doppler systems, one centred on 8.8 GHz generating a f d\nof about 1.5 KHz per 100 kt, and the other on 13.3 GHz giving a f d of about 2.3 KHz per 100 kt \n(assuming a depression angle of 60\u00ba). \nSingle Beam Systems \n10. So far the system described has used a single fixed beam radiating forwards and downwards \nfrom the aircraft as shown in Fig 3.  The Doppler shift would be the same if the beam were directed \nrearwards and downwards, although the received frequency would in that case be less than the \ntransmitted frequency i.e. \u2013f d.  However, such a single beam system would have a number of \ndisadvantages:\na. Transmitter Instability.  High-powered I/J-band transmitters tend to suffer from some \ninstability of frequency and if the frequency should drift between the time of transmission and the \ntime of reception of the reflected signal an incorrect f d would be measured leading to an error in \nmeasured groundspeed. \nb. Pitch Error.  Unless the aerial was stabilized in the pitching plane, the depression angle \nwould be dependent on the attitude of the aircraft.  Thus deviations from level flight would result in \nchanges to f d even if the horizontal velocity of the aircraft remained constant.  The consequent \nerrors in computed groundspeed would be significant, typical values being 3% for 1\u00ba of pitch and \n15% for 5\u00ba of pitch. \nc. Vertical Motion.  Any vertical motion of the aerial would generate a Doppler shift not \nassociated with a change in groundspeed.", "question": "What are the disadvantages of using a single fixed beam system in Doppler navigation radar?", "answer": "The disadvantages of using a single fixed beam system in Doppler navigation radar include transmitter instability, pitch error, vertical motion, and noise. Transmitter instability can lead to incorrect measurements of the Doppler shift and groundspeed if the frequency drifts between transmission and reception. Pitch error can cause changes in the Doppler shift even if the horizontal velocity remains constant, leading to significant errors in computed groundspeed. Vertical motion generates a Doppler shift not associated with a change in groundspeed. Lastly, the received signal can be contaminated by noise from various sources, including the transmitter, aerial, receiver, and atmosphere."}, {"context": "d. Drift Error.  In a fixed single aerial system the Doppler shift would be measured horizontally \nalong the direction of the beam, thus velocity would be calculated along heading, whereas \ngroundspeed is measured along track.  This error could be eradicated by rotating the aerial until a \nmaximum Doppler shift was obtained, at the same time determining the drift angle by the amount \nof aerial rotation.  However, this technique is imprecise in practice and is not used any longer \neven in multiple beam systems. \nTwo Beam Systems \n11.

The frequency of the signal received from the forward beam, f r, is higher than the transmitted \nfrequency, f, by an amount equal to the Doppler shift, f d, i.e.: \nfr = f + f d\nThe frequency received from the rearward beam has a negative Doppler shift of the same magnitude, i.e.: \nfr = f \u2212 f d\nIn a two beam system these two received signals can be mixed together and the difference frequency \nextracted as a beat frequency, f b, such that:\nfb = (f + f d) \u2212 (f \u2013 f d) = 2f d\n\u03b8coscVf 4ie\n13. The beat frequency produced by a two beam system has twice the value of that from a single\nbeam allowing greater precision in the measurement of groundspeed.  Variations in transmitter \nfrequency become less important as such changes affect the forward and rearward echo signals \nequally, and are therefore cancelled when taking the difference frequency.  Similarly, any changes in \nthe aircraft\u2019s vertical speed will be sensed by both beams and will be cancelled. Pitch errors will cause\nan increase in depression angle for one beam and a decrease in depression angle for the other beam, \nwhich although not providing complete compensation does reduce the errors significantly; 5\u00ba of pitch \nwill cause an error of around 0.38%.  However, such a two beam system cannot be used to determine \ndrift accurately and most modern systems use four or three beam arrangements.\nFour and Three Beam Systems \n14. Four beam systems, known as Janus arrays, provide for the accurate measurement of both\ngroundspeed and drift.

This problem is overcome in some systems by using\nfrequency modulated CW (FMCW), which permits the rejection of signals which have been reflected from \nnearby objects.", "question": "What type of transmissions can be used in Doppler equipments?", "answer": "Either pulsed or continuous wave (CW) transmissions can be used in Doppler equipments."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-7 - Doppler Navigation Radar \nRevised Jun 10  Page 7 of 13 18. In pulsed systems the pulse recurrence frequency (PRF) must not be allowed to produce spurious \nsignals in the Doppler frequency band and is therefore made very high, usually at least twice as high as \nthe highest expected Doppler frequency. \nBeam Shapes \n19. The analysis so far has assumed that the radar energy is transmitted in pencil beams, each of \nwhich is reflected at any instant from a single point on the ground.  However, in reality the beams must \nhave a finite width and must illuminate a finite area of ground.  The total reflected signal at each aerial \nis therefore composed of the vector sum of signals from a very large number of reflecting points.  The \nDoppler frequency shift from any reflecting point is proportional only to the speed of the aircraft, the \nangle between the line of flight and the transmitted beam, and the frequency.  It is independent of the \ndistance of the reflecting point from the aircraft and so the same Doppler shift is produced over flat \nterrain as over more mountainous country.  \n20. The Doppler frequency change is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the line of flight \nand the beam and thus all reflecting points which lie on the surface of a cone of semi-angle\u03b8, whose\naxis coincides with the direction of motion, produce a Doppler frequency of \u03b8.coscfV2   Thus if the \ntransmitted beams are so shaped as to form parts of conical surfaces, a groundspeed measurement\nmay be obtained as accurate and unambiguous as that from pencil beams.  This arrangement is \nillustrated in Fig 9 and the beams are achieved by an aerial system known as a 'squinting linear array'. \n11-7 Fig 9 A Practical Doppler Beam Shape \n21.

Electro-mechanical Frequency Tracking.  Electro-mechanical systems employ a device known \nas a phonic wheel oscillator which produces an oscillatory output voltage.  The frequency can be varied \nover the range of the Doppler spectrum by varying the speed of rotation of the phonic wheel shaft.  In \nolder 'two-window' systems two oscillators are used, the output frequencies of each differing by a fixed \namount. The incoming Doppler signal is fed to two discriminator circuits, to one of which is also fed the \nlower phonic wheel frequency and to the other the higher.  The output of each discriminator is a measure \nof the energy contained in a narrow window of the Doppler spectrum centred on the phonic wheel \nfrequency.  If the two discriminator outputs are equal, the two windows contain equal amounts of energy, \nand must therefore be symmetrically disposed around the centre frequency as in Fig 12a. If the outputs \nare different, the windows are displaced from the symmetrical position as in Fig 12b, and the difference in \noutputs is used as an error signal to realign the phonic wheel frequencies until parity is achieved.

The Doppler spectrum is applied to \ntwo mixer circuits, each of which is also fed with the phonic wheel frequency, but with a 90\u00ba phase \ndifference to each.  The output of the mixers is fed to a two phase motor (integrator motor), which turns in \none direction if the phonic wheel frequency is higher than the mid Doppler frequency, and in the other \ndirection if it is lower.

Height Hole Error. A pulsed Doppler radar cannot transmit and receive signals at the same time \nand it is therefore possible for a reflected signal to be lost if it arrives back at the receiver at the same time \nas a pulse is being transmitted.  The effect, known as height hole error, occurs at certain aircraft heights \ndependent on the pulse recurrence frequency (PRF) of the radar.  Over uneven ground the slant range of \nthe illuminated area of ground is continually varying and is unlikely to remain at a critical value long \nenough for height hole error to be significant.  Over the sea however the aircraft height is liable to remain \nconstant for a longer period and prolonged loss of signal may occur.  A similar effect occurs with FMCW \ntransmissions when the aircraft is at such a height that the reflected signal at the instant of reception, is in \nphase with the transmitter and is therefore rejected.  Height hole error is usually avoided by varying the \nPRF of a pulsed system, or the modulation frequency of a FMCW system. \n27. Sea Bias.

There are two causes: \na. Tidal Streams.  The speed of tidal streams is generally greatest in narrow waterways and, \nsince the time during which an aircraft is likely to be affected is small, the effect is minimal.  \nOcean currents occupy much larger areas but their speed is low and so cause little error. \nb. Water Transport.  Wind causes movement in a body of water and, although wave motion is \nquite complex, the net effect so far as Doppler systems are concerned is a down-wind movement \nof the surface.  The resultant error is an up-wind displacement of a Doppler derived position.  An \napproximate value for the error can be derived by considering an error vector in the measured drift \nand groundspeed which has a direction in the up-wind direction of the surface wind, and a length\nequal to about one fifth of the surface wind speed, with a maximum of approximately 8 kt.  \n29. Flight Path and Pitch Error.  In climb and descent a true speed over the ground will be calculated \nonly if the Doppler aerial is maintained horizontal. Partial compensation for pitch is inherent in multiple\nbeam systems (see para 13) and errors can be further reduced, if necessary, by gyro-stabilizing the aerial \nto the horizontal, or by correcting the errors using attitude information in the groundspeed computer.  \nWithout these facilities, and with the aerial slaved to the aircraft\u2019s flight path or to the airframe, a small \nerror will be introduced.\n30.

Computational Errors.  Doppler systems are mechanized on the assumption than 1 nm is \nequivalent to 1' of latitude.  However, the actual change of latitude in minutes, equating to a distance of \none nautical mile measured on the Earths surface along a meridian, ranges from 1.0056' at the \nEquator to 0.9954' at the poles, and is only correct at 47\u00ba 42' N and S.  Furthermore, 1' of latitude \nchange equates to a greater distance at height than on the surface.  Fig 15 illustrates error due to \nheight, by showing the comparable distance at sea level.  Errors due to latitude and height are small \nand are not normally corrected for in navigation.  Additional small errors can be introduced into position \ncalculations.  Since the aircraft never flies in a straight line, but rather weaves slowly from side to side \nof track, the calculated distance gone will exceed the distance directly measured on a map.  Doppler \ndrift is added to heading to deduce track and so any error in the heading input will result in an error in \nany computed position.  \n11-7 Fig 15 Height Error \n\u03b8Error due \nto Height\nR\u03b8(R+h)\u03b8\nRadius of \nEarth (R)Surface\nofEarthHeight above\nSurface (h)\nComputer Display \n33.

Ground Mapping Radar (GMR) carried in aircraft will present the operator with an image of terrain \nfeatures, which can then be used to aid navigation, locate targets and determine weapon aiming \nparameters.  In addition, the skilled operator will be able to interpret terrain relief, including those hills \nwhose elevation is higher than the aircraft\u2019s altitude. \n2. From even the most basic radar mapping display, the operator will be able to define a range and \nrelative bearing to a recognizable ground feature, and then plot the reciprocal to obtain a 'range and \nbearing' fix (Volume 9, Chapter 2). \n3. A GMR is often one component of an integrated navigation and weapon aiming system, such that \ndata derived from the radar can be used directly to update the aircraft\u2019s present position.  Conversely, \ndata from the rest of the system can be used to enhance the radar facilities (e.g. Doppler or inertial \nvelocities may be used to stabilize the radar image and superimpose electronic cursors).  \n4. Radar can provide a means of navigation which is independent of ground beacons.  The operator \ncan acquire information from the radar display in all but the most extreme weather conditions.  Radar \nalso has a relatively long-range capability, only limited by the equipment parameters and Earth \ncurvature.  It is therefore possible to find distinctive ground features, such as coastlines, at extreme \nrange.  However, it is important to note that the information received and displayed by a radar may be \nambiguous to the unskilled, or ill-prepared operator.  Hence, accurate interpretation of radar displays \nrequires some knowledge of basic radar principles, and the nature of reflectors. \nBASIC RADAR PRINCIPLES\nBasic Principles of Pulse Radar \n5. A GMR uses pulse radar techniques, which are explained fully in Volume 11, Chapter 2.

This energy travels at the speed of light and is reflected back to the antenna when it encounters a target. The radar receiver then detects the reflected energy, and the time delay between the transmission and reception of the pulse is measured to determine the range of the target. The range resolution of the radar is determined by the length of the transmitted pulse, and the antenna is a directional device that radiates energy in a particular direction with a gain and beamwidth that are inversely proportional and related to the size of the antenna."}, {"context": "6. Determination of Range.  Pulse Radar determines the range of a target by 'pulse/time' \ntechnique.  The airborne radar fires a pulse of energy, which is reflected by the target, and returns to \nthe radar aerial (see Fig 1).  The range from the aerial to the target is measured by observing the \nelapsed time (t) between the leading edge of the pulse being transmitted from the aerial, and the \nleading edge of the associated return (known as an 'echo'), arriving back at the aerial.  The range of a \ntarget can therefore be expressed as: \n2c tRange\u00d7=\nwhere c = the velocity of propagation of the pulse (3 \u00d7 108 metres per second).  The range of a target \nmay be measured on the radar display by eye, or by electronic means.", "question": "What is the formula for determining the range of a target using pulse radar?", "answer": "The formula for determining the range of a target using pulse radar is: 2c tRange\u00d7=, where c is the velocity of propagation of the pulse (3 \u00d7 108 metres per second) and t is the elapsed time between the leading edge of the pulse being transmitted and the leading edge of the associated return (echo) arriving back at the aerial."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-8 - Ground Mapping Radar \nRevised Jun 10 Page 2 of 2111-8 Fig 1 Measuring Range by Pulse/Time Technique \nFig 1a Transmitted Pulse Outbound TargetLeading Edge\nFig 1b Return of Reflected PulseTargetLeading Edge\n7. Determination of Bearing.  To detect the bearing of a target, the aerial beam is moved in azimuth.  \nThis aerial movement (known as 'scanning') is synchronized with the radar display such that when an \necho is received from a target, the radar time base is at the correct bearing on the radar display.\n8. Radar Displays.  There are some airborne installations which have a 360\u00ba Plan Position Indicator (PPI) \ndisplay (see Volume 11, Chapter 1).  More commonly, however, the radar is mounted in the aircraft nose and \nscans a sector ahead of the aircraft, typically 60\u00ba either side of the aircraft heading or track. In this case, the\nground mapping picture will be presented on a Sector PPI display as illustrated in Fig 2. \n11-8 Fig 2 Layout of a Sector PPI Display\n 0 \n2010\n4030\n40302010\n5050Heading or \nTrack Datum\nAzimuth\nAngle\nRange\nAircraft\u2019s Position \n  (point of origin)Time Bases\nReturn \nSignal\nRepresentation of Terrain Features \n9. A radar map of an area of the terrain is achieved by scanning the radar beam in azimuth, either\nmechanically (by moving the aerial) or electronically (by using a phased array antenna).

The time base is intensity modulated in response to the signal strength of received echoes.  Those \nradar targets that are highly reflective will return a greater proportion of the original transmitted energy \nthan poor reflectors and will thus be the brightest objects on the display. In practical terms, the \nhuman eye can only make out 3 or 4 shades of brightness of return echoes (Fig 3) on a mono-colour \ndisplay.  However, operator fatigue or unsuitable lighting conditions might diminish this capability.  In \ngeneral, the ground features will be represented by: \na. The brightest returns from highly reflective targets, typical of town centres and industrial \ncomplexes. \nb. Medium intensity returns from targets of average reflectivity. \nc.

Operating Frequency.  As explained in Volume 9, as with all radar parameters, the choice of \noperating frequency is inevitably a compromise between conflicting requirements.  High frequencies \nallow narrow beamwidths to be achieved with relatively small aerials, and pulse lengths to be \nrelatively short - both attributes leading to improved resolution.  Additionally, high frequency \nequipment tends to have size and weight advantages.  Conversely, high frequency radar is \nrestricted in the power that can be employed, and consequently in its maximum effective range.  \nFurthermore, the higher the frequency, the more the radar will be susceptible to interference and \natmospheric attenuation.  In practice, the majority of airborne mapping radars operate in the I or J \nband with frequencies around 10 GHz (wavelengths around 3 cm). \n14. Pulse Width and Pulse Length.  The duration of a transmitted pulse can be measured in time \n(pulse width (PW)) or distance (pulse length (PL)). As both terms are interrelated, either may be used\nto describe this parameter.  \na. The energy content of a pulse is directly proportional to its length (Fig 5).  Thus, a longer \npulse will give a stronger return echo from targets at long range.  However, shorter pulses will \nenable the radar to resolve (separate) closely spaced targets in range.  This point will be \ndiscussed in detail at a later stage within this chapter.\n11-8 Fig 5 Pulse Parameters \nPeak\nPowerTime     Pulse of\nElectromagnetic\n      EnergyPower(Pulse Length\n  if measured \n  in Distance)Pulse Width\nb.

The pulse length also determines the minimum range that the radar can measure, with the minimum range being equal to the pulse length divided by two."}, {"context": "A \npulse occupies 300 m for every microsecond of duration and so, for a typical PW of 2 \u00b5sec, the \nreturn distance will be 600 m, giving a minimum range of 300 m.  In practice the minimum \nrange will be greater than this since some finite time will be necessary for the aerial to switch \nfrom transmission to reception. \nThe PW for a GMR is usually between 0.5 and 5 \u00b5sec. \n15. Pulse Recurrence (or Repetition) Frequency (PRF).  The PRF is defined as the number of \npulses occurring in one second and must be sufficiently high to ensure that at least one pulse of \nenergy strikes a target while the scanner is pointing in its direction.  A very narrow radar beamwidth, \nwith a high rate of scanner rotation therefore needs a high PRF.  In practice, the relationship between \nscanner rate, beamwidth and the PRF is adjusted such that any target will receive between 5 and 25 \npulses each time it is swept by the beam.  However, if the PRF is too high, it will limit the radar\u2019s \nmaximum unambiguous range.  The PRF of a GMR is typically between 200 and 5,000 pulses per \nsecond and is normally determined by the range scale selected.", "question": "What is the definition of Pulse Recurrence (or Repetition) Frequency (PRF)?", "answer": "The Pulse Recurrence (or Repetition) Frequency (PRF) is defined as the number of pulses occurring in one second."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-8 - Ground Mapping Radar \nRevised Jun 10 Page 5 of 2116. Aerial Stabilization.  The radar aerial must be stabilized, within limits, to the true horizontal both \nin roll and pitch to avoid distortion of the ground image.  This is normally achieved by using inputs from \nthe aircraft attitude system - the degree of roll and pitch for which compensation can be provided will \nvary between aircraft types.  In addition to the radar image, it is possible to superimpose electronically \nproduced symbols and cursors on to the display.  In some systems a topographical map can also be \nprojected onto the display (see Volume 7, Chapter 30). \nBeam Characteristics \n17. Vertical Beamwidth.  The beam of a GMR must be broad in the vertical plane in order to \nilluminate all of the ground between a point beneath the aircraft and the horizon (or effective range).  A \npencil beam, as produced by a parabolic aerial (Fig 6), is not ideal for mapping purposes since it does \nnot illuminate sufficient area of ground.

Azimuth Beamwidth. The beam of a GMR must be narrow in azimuth so that the bearing of any \necho can be defined accurately.  It is impossible to produce a beam in which all of the radar energy is \ndistributed and confined within a finite beam.  However, with a well-designed antenna, most of the \nradiated power can be constrained to a given direction as illustrated by a typical polar diagram (Fig 9).  \nIt is impossible to eradicate the side lobes completely, but it is desirable to minimize them since they \nrepresent wasted power, and their presence makes the radar more vulnerable to interference. \n11-8 Fig 9 Half Power Beam Width \nSide Lobes Main Lobe\nHalf Power PointsAC\n\u03b8\nD\n20.Nominal Beamwidth.  The nominal beamwidth (NBW) is defined as the angle subtended at the \nsource by the lines joining the two points on the radiation diagram where the power has fallen to a \ncertain proportion (usually a half) of its maximum value.  Radiation patterns are normally plotted \nshowing relative field strengths, and, since field strength is proportional to the square root of power, \nthe corresponding half power points C and D on the field strength diagram shown in Fig 9 are where \nthe field strength has fallen to 0.5, ie 0.707, of the maximum value AB.

Effective Beamwidth.  From an operator\u2019s perspective, the apparent, or effective beamwidth (EBW) \nis of more concern than the NBW since it is one factor which influences the accuracy with which radar \nreturns are displayed.  The EBW is the angle through which the beam rotates whilst continuing to give a \ndiscernible image from a point response. Fig 10 illustrates the effect of a radar beam with an EBW of 4\u00ba\nscanning clockwise through a point target, due north of the aircraft.  Fig 10b shows that the target will be \ndisplayed on the CRT once the leading edge (LE) of the beam intercepts it.  In this instance, it will not be \nportrayed on its correct bearing of 360\u00ba, but in the direction in which the aerial centreline and time base is \npointing, ie along 358\u00ba. The target continues to be displayed until the trailing edge (TE) of the beam has\npassed through it (Fig 10d). The effect is to spread the image of the point target response across the \nEBW - in this case 4\u00ba.  It is possible to calculate the resultant distortion.  In the example used, if the point \ntarget (treated as zero width) was at a range of 60 nm, it would appear on the displays to be 4 nm wide (1 \nin 60 rule), i.e. 2 nm either side of the correct bearing.", "question": "What is the effect of the effective beamwidth on the display of radar returns?", "answer": "The effective beamwidth (EBW) influences the accuracy with which radar returns are displayed. As the radar beam rotates, the target will be displayed on the CRT once the leading edge of the beam intercepts it, but not on its correct bearing. Instead, it will be displayed in the direction in which the aerial centerline and time base is pointing. The target continues to be displayed until the trailing edge of the beam has passed through it, spreading the image of the point target response across the EBW. This can result in significant distortion of the target's display, as seen in the example where a point target at a range of 60 nm would appear 4 nm wide on the displays."}, {"context": "2 nm either side of the correct bearing.\n11-8 Fig 10 Effective Beamwidth \nFig 10a \nBeam CL at 356\u00b0 Fig 10b \nBeam CL at 358\u00b0 Fig 10c \nBeam CL at 360\u00b0 Fig 10d \nBeam CL at 002\u00b0 \nTELECL\nEBW = 4oTarget\nClockwise\nscan\nTarget not yet\non DisplayTimebase\naligned with\nCL of beamTE LE\nTarget appears onTimebase at 358oTE LE\nTarget remains\nilluminatedTE LE\nTarget remains\nilluminated until TE\nof beam is clear22.Use of Receiver Gain Control.  The EBW is largely a function of receiver gain.  Both transmitted \npower and receiver sensitivity are maximum along the beam centre line, decreasing towards the beam \nmargins. The receiver gain control determines the overall amplification of the received signal.  This \namplification may be reduced, by the operator, until the signals near to the centreline of the beam are only \njust above the visibility threshold. This will produce an extremely narrow EBW.  Fig 11 shows a cross-section \nof signal strength across the beam, in Cartesian co-ordinates.  The comparison between high and low gain \nsettings demonstrates resulting change in EBW.  Alternatively, receiver gain may be increased so that \nsignals at the edge of the beam are amplified sufficiently to exceed the visibility threshold.", "question": "What is the effect of receiver gain control on the effective beamwidth?", "answer": "The receiver gain control determines the overall amplification of the received signal, which can significantly affect the effective beamwidth (EBW). When the receiver gain is reduced, the signals near the centerline of the beam become barely visible, resulting in a very narrow EBW. Conversely, when the receiver gain is increased, the signals at the edge of the beam are amplified enough to exceed the visibility threshold, leading to a wider EBW. Therefore, the operator can adjust the EBW to suit the specific target and environmental conditions by manipulating the receiver gain control."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-8 - Ground Mapping Radar \nRevised Jun 10 Page 8 of 2111-8 Fig 11 Gain Level and Effective Beam Width \nMaximumVisibility Level\nVisibility\nThreshold  EBW at \nHigh Gain\nBeam Angular Displacement EBW at \nLow Gain\nReceiver\nAmplification\nLevel\nCLHigh Gain\nLow Gain\nRADAR DISTORTIONS\nDistortions Inherent in Radar \n23. A radar reflective target will not be portrayed accurately in size and shape on the CRT due to a \ncombination of distortions that are inherent in radar.  The size of a received signal is always \nexaggerated. The distortions applicable to each radar return are:\na. Beamwidth distortion.\nb. Pulse length distortion.\nc. Spot size distortion.\n24. Beamwidth (BW) Distortion.  The cause of BW distortion has already been explained in Para \n21.  The effect is to add one half of the EBW to each side of the target as shown in Fig 12.  The size of \nBW distortion can be determined using 1 in 60 calculations. \nExample: In Fig 12, if the EBW is 3\u00ba, and the target is at 60 nm range, then the BW distortion will\nextend the width of the target by \u00bd \u00d7 EBW on each side of the target. \nAt 60 nm range, 1\u00ba subtends 1nm (6076 ft) \nEBW     =   3\u00ba  =   3 nm   =   18,228 ft \n\u2234\u00bd EBW = 9,114 ft on each side of the target. \nIn this example, when at 30 nm range, \u00bd EBW would equal 4,557 ft.", "question": "What is the cause and effect of beamwidth distortion in radar?", "answer": "The cause of beamwidth (BW) distortion is the combination of distortions that are inherent in radar.

The range to the near edge of a target is correctly determined by half \nthe time taken for the leading edge of the pulse to reach the target and return, multiplied by the propagation \nspeed. However, although the range to the far side of target is similarly determined by the leading edge of\nthe pulse, the CRT continues to 'paint' until the whole PL has completely returned from the far side of the \ntarget. The effect is to extend the far edge of the target by an amount equivalent to \u00bd \u00d7 PL.  PL distortion is \nadded to the target and also to the BW distortion, as shown in Fig 13. \nExample:  A radar with a PW of 1 \u00b5sec (which gives a PL of approximately 300 metres) will \nproduce a PL distortion of 150 metres. \n11-8 Fig 13 Pulse Length Distortion \nR adarP ulse L ength\nDistortion\n   \u00bd\nPulse\nLengthTarget\n26. Spot Size (SS) Distortion.  The electron beam which produces the image on the CRT has a finite \nsize, and nothing less than a minimal 'spot size' can be displayed. The radar will try to paint the outside \nedges of a response with the centre of the spot.  This will draw the correct outline, but the image is blurred \nby the addition of a margin with a thickness equal to the radius of the spot size (i.e.  \u00bd \u00d7 SS), as \nillustrated in Fig 14.  Adjustments to focus and brilliance will affect the SS.  However, SS is a function \nof the physical size of the radar display screen, so its real dimension does not change.  The main \nfactor affecting the size of the distortion due to SS distortion is therefore the range scale selected.  SS \ndistortion is relatively greater on smaller scales (i.e. on greater ranges).", "question": "What is the effect of pulse length distortion on a radar with a pulse width of 1 \u00b5sec?", "answer": "The pulse length distortion on a radar with a pulse width of 1 \u00b5sec is an extension of the far edge of the target by an amount equivalent to half of the pulse length, which in this case is 150 meters."}, {"context": "on greater ranges).

Effect of Radar Distortions on 'No-show' Targets. The radar distortions increase the size of \nreturn echoes.  However, it should be noted that targets that do not reflect radar energy back to the \naircraft, e.g. lakes, will be decreased in size, as a result of distortion of the surrounding ground returns \n(Fig 16).  In practical terms, at longer ranges, small coastal estuaries, and small inland lakes are \ngenerally indiscernible, and islands often appear as joined onto the mainland.  However, resolution will \nimprove as range decreases. \n11-8 Fig 16 Total Radar Distortions for a Non-reflecting Target \nR adar\nOriginal outline of 'no-show' T argetR esultant size of 'no-show'", "question": "What is the effect of radar distortions on targets that do not reflect radar energy back to the aircraft?", "answer": "Radar distortions decrease the size of return echoes for targets that do not reflect radar energy back to the aircraft, such as lakes.

However, resolution will improve as range decreases."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-8 - Ground Mapping Radar \nRevised Jun 10 Page 11 of 2129.Height Distortion.  The range measured by a mapping radar is slant range, whereas for a \ncompletely accurate display, plan range is needed.  If such accuracy is necessary (e.g. for high \naltitude, close range radar interpretation) the CRT time base can be made non-linear, i.e.  the electron \nbeam producing the time base moves faster at the start of its movement from the point of origin, and \nslows gradually towards maximum range.  Even so, it is not possible to remove all of the distortion \nclose to the point of origin. \n30. Minimizing the Effect of Radar Distortions.  The combined distortions produced by a radar will \nbe minimized if the operator obeys the following rules: \na. Once the fix has been positively identified, reduce the gain setting in order to reduce EBW. \nb. Take the fix at close range, using the smallest range scale practicable (to minimize EBW, SS \nand PL). \nc. An isolated target can be assumed to lie at the centre of the response (see Fig 15). \nThe Resolution Rectangle \n31. As a result of radar distortions, radar targets separated in azimuth by less than EBW + SS will \nmerge together on the radar display (Fig 17). \n11-8 Fig 17 Target Resolution in Azimuth \n\u00bd SS \u00bd SS \u00bd SS\n\u00bd EBW \u00bd EBW\nAerialRadar BeamTargets", "question": "What is the effect of reducing the gain setting in a radar system?", "answer": "Reducing the gain setting in a radar system helps to reduce Electronic Beam Width (EBW), which in turn minimizes radar distortions."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-8 - Ground Mapping Radar \nRevised Jun 10 Page 12 of 21Similarly, echoes separated in range by less than \u00bd PL + SS will merge (Fig 18).   \n11-8 Fig 18 Target Resolution in Range \nTargets\nAerialRadar Beam\u00bd PL\u00bd SS\u00bd SS\n32. The area defined by the two dimensions (EBW + SS) and (\u00bd PL + SS), is known as the \n'Resolution Rectangle' (Fig 19).  Any two reflecting objects on the ground, lying within an area the size \nof the resolution rectangle will not resolve into separate images on the radar display. \n11-8 Fig 19 The Resolution Rectangle Targets\nEBW\n+ SS\u00bd PL\n+ SS", "question": "What is the area defined by the two dimensions (EBW + SS) and (\u00bd PL + SS) called in ground mapping radar?", "answer": "This area is known as the 'Resolution Rectangle'."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-8 - Ground Mapping Radar \nRevised Jun 10 Page 13 of 2133. When a radar response consists of several buildings in a group, the operator can determine \nwhether they will remain as one response, or resolve into individual responses, by use of simple \ncalculation based on the Resolution Rectangle. \nExample 1:  Two targets are 1,500 ft apart in azimuth.  If EBW = 2\u00ba and SS (of the chosen range \ndisplay scale) = 400 ft, at what range will they resolve into two? \nResolution will occur when EBW + SS is less than 1,500 ft. \n1,500 \u2013 400 = 1,100 ft \n\u2234 EBW will need to be less than 1,100 ft \nUsing 1 in 60, at 60 nm range, 2\u00ba EBW subtends 2 nm (12,152 ft), so: \n152 , 1260\n100 , 1x=\nnm 43 . 5 60152 , 12100 , 1x= \u00d7 =\u2234\nTherefore, resolution will occur at ranges closer than 5.43 nm.\nExample 2:  Two targets are 900 ft apart in range.  Will they resolve on a display, assuming that \nSS = 300 ft and PL = 600 ft? \nResolution in range will occur when separation is greater than SS + \u00bd PL. \nSS + \u00bd PL   =   300 ft + 300 ft =   600 ft. \nTherefore, these two targets will resolve on the 20 nm range scale display. \nRADAR REFLECTORS \n34. The creation of a map-like image on a radar display relies on the relative strengths of the reflected \nenergy returned from the various terrain features.  In turn, the amount of reflected energy depends \nupon the material of the target, and, even more so, on the direction in which the radar energy is \nreflected.\nReflectivity of Materials \n35.

Radar energy is reflected in the same manner as other electromagnetic waves, such as light.  \nTwo types of reflection situations may be recognized, specular and diffuse.\n37.Specular Reflection.  If the radar energy impinges on a smooth surface the reflection is known \nas specular and is the same as light being reflected from a mirror, ie with the angle of reflection equal \nto the angle of incidence (Fig 21). A surface may be considered smooth if is approximately planar and\ncontains no irregularities comparable in size with, or larger than, the wavelength of the radar.  From a \nhorizontal surface, specular reflection causes the energy to be directed away from the receiver.  Such \na surface will therefore appear dark on the display.  Specular reflection is typical of smooth water and \nfine sand. For a specular surface to give a good reflection back to the aircraft, it must be at, or near to\nthe normal (ie 90\u00ba) to the radar beam.  \n11-8 Fig 21 Specular Reflection \nIncident RayNormal\nReflected RayReflecting SurfaceAngle of\nIncidenceAngle of\nReflection\n38.Multiple Specular Reflectors. A pair of specular reflecting surfaces, mutually at right angles, will\nreturn a signal at the same angle of elevation as the incident energy, but not necessarily at the same \nangle in azimuth.  This scenario is shown in Fig 22, with a concrete surface area and a factory wall.", "question": "What is a scenario where a ground mapping radar can receive a signal back at the same angle of elevation but at a different angle in azimuth?", "answer": "A scenario would be when there are two specular reflecting surfaces, such as a concrete surface area and a factory wall, that are mutually at right angles. The concrete surface area is at right angles to the radar beam, while the factory wall is at an angle of 45\u00ba to the radar beam. The signal is reflected from the concrete surface area at an angle of 45\u00ba to the horizontal and then from the factory wall at an angle of 45\u00ba to the horizontal. This results in the signal being returned to the aircraft at the same angle of elevation as the incident energy, but at an angle of 90\u00ba in azimuth."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-8 - Ground Mapping Radar \nRevised Jun 10 Page 15 of 2111-8 Fig 22 Reflection from Two Specular Surfaces \nFig 22a Elevation Fig 22b Plan \nSurfaceRadar\nEnergy\nFrom\nAircraftReflection at\nSame Elevation Angle\nBuilding\nx xy\nyBuilding\nRadar Energy\nfrom AircraftReflection AwayFrom Aircraft\nz\nz\n39.Corner Reflectors.  Where three mutually perpendicular, specular surfaces exist, the geometry is \nsuch that energy is reflected back to the source regardless of the angle of incidence.  This \narrangement is known as a corner reflector.  Although rare in natural terrain features, corner reflectors \nfrequently occur in built-up areas, as in Fig 23, and are largely responsible for the bright display of such \nareas.  Radar reflectors employing this principle are widely manufactured to enhance the radar \nreflectivity of, for example, runway thresholds, small boats and targets on bombing ranges. \n11-8 Fig 23 Corner Reflector in Built-up Area \nDiffuse Reflectors \n40. Diffuse Reflection.  When a reflecting surface is rough, i.e. when its irregularities are comparable in \nsize with, or larger than, the radar wavelength, then that surface acts as a mosaic of randomly orientated\nspecular reflecting surfaces.  As a result, the reflected energy is diffused in all directions (Fig 24).  The \namount of energy reflected in any direction is less than would occur in a single specular reflection.  Diffuse \nreflection is uncommon in man-made structures but is typical of normal undeveloped land and accounts \nfor the intermediate tone of such terrain on the display. The proportion of the energy which is reflected\nback to the receiver depends largely on the angle of incidence. \n11-8 Fig 24 Examples of Diffuse Reflection\nFig 24a Small Angle of Incidence Fig 24b Large Angle of Incidence \nIncident EnergyReflected Energy\nIncident EnergyReflected Energy", "question": "What is a corner reflector and how does it work?", "answer": "A corner reflector is an arrangement of three mutually perpendicular, specular surfaces that reflects energy back to the source regardless of the angle of incidence.

Even large complexes may give only poor reflection when the angle of incidence of the\ntransmitted energy is away from the normal.  This phenomenon was first noticed with towns and cities \nin the USA, which tend to be laid out on a N/S and E/W orientated grid.

As the aircraft proceeds along its track, the \ndifferent reflectors found within the complex will produce echoes of varying strengths.  In Fig 26, the \naircraft at point 1 will receive good echoes from surfaces A and B.  However, by point 2, surface A can \nbe almost discounted, and point B has developed into a strong corner reflector.

The skill of the operator is\nrequired to determine which response, within a series or group, is that of the required fix point, and \nwhich other echoes may be ignored. \nHigh/Medium Level Radar Interpretation\n45. Selection of Fix Points.  When selecting fix points for radar interpretation at high or medium \nlevel, the following factors should be considered: \na.Material. The fix point should be a good reflector, and therefore probably a man-made\nstructure. \nb. Size.  The size of the reflecting object will affect the size and brightness of the response on \nthe radar screen.  A larger target will probably be easier to identify, but due to distortions, it may \nbe more difficult to determine a point on it with any precision. \nc. Contrast.  Contrast between the received radar return and its adjacent background will aid \nidentification.  The table below shows the 3 main groups of reflecting ground surfaces and the \nstrength of their return signals. \nType of Surface Strength of Echo \nWater Weak \nTerrain Medium \nCultural Strong\nSince water, in general, reflects little or no energy back to the receiver, the best contrast is usually \nafforded by a cultural return against a water background.  Examples of fix points in this category \ninclude large bridges (such as the Severn, Forth and Humber Bridges), coastal refineries and oil \nrigs.  The contrast between water/terrain is better than terrain/cultural, therefore the second \nchoice should be coastlines or large water features.  Finally, if the preceding options are not \navailable, then a fix can be obtained from terrain/cultural contrast.  Fix points in this category \ninclude towns/cities, power stations, large industrial complexes and airfields. \nd. Isolation.  A target that is isolated should prove easier to identify than a target within a group. \ne. Ambiguity.  When the target is adjacent to, or surrounded by other reflective complexes, it may \nbe difficult to identify.  The operator can use patterns of responses to assist with this process.", "question": "What are the factors to consider when selecting fix points for radar interpretation at high or medium level?", "answer": "When selecting fix points for radar interpretation at high or medium level, the following factors should be considered: Material, Size, Contrast, Isolation, Ambiguity, Distance, and Movement."}, {"context": "f.Transmitted Power. The higher the amount of transmitted power, the stronger the reflected\nechoes will be.  It must be remembered that if the transmitted power is increased by selecting a \nlonger PL, then the PL distortion will be greater. \ng. Range.  At longer range, smaller isolated targets may not show.  Also, at long range, BW \ndistortion is greater, and depending upon the radar parameters set, PL distortion is probably \ngreater also.  It is therefore more accurate to fix at close range. \nh.Aspect. The angle of approach will influence the strength of the return signals (the cardinal\neffect).  In addition, by selecting a fix point ahead of the aircraft, and close to track, aspect change \ncan be avoided. \ni.Terrain Screening.  The short wavelength radar energy travels in straight lines.  Therefore, \nany solid obstruction, such as a hill, will cast a 'radar shadow' on the far side. Any objects in the\nshadow area will not receive radar energy (Fig 27a) and cannot therefore reflect any.", "question": "What is the effect of increasing transmitted power on reflected echoes?", "answer": "The higher the amount of transmitted power, the stronger the reflected echoes will be. However, it's important to note that increasing transmitted power by selecting a longer pulse length (PL) will also increase PL distortion."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-8 - Ground Mapping Radar \nRevised Jun 10 Page 18 of 2111-8 Fig 27 Terrain Screening \nFig 27a Cross-section Fig 27b Radar Display \nRadar Shadowcaused by Hill\nHigh\nGround\nIndustrial\nComplex\nHill TopsHill\nShadow\nOn the radar display, an area of terrain screening will appear as a dark 'shadow' area containing \nno radar returns (Fig 27b). If approaching a target which is behind a hill, it is possible to\ndetermine, by trigonometry, at what range the target will appear out of hill shadow (over small \ndistances, Earth curvature can effectively be ignored in the calculation). \nIn summary, the 'ideal' radar fix point should be sufficiently large, a good reflector, unique, and exhibit\ngood contrast against its background.  \n46. Identification of Fix Points.  To identify a specific target on a radar screen, the operator should: \na. Use larger, easily identified responses to help identify the smaller, unknown responses. \nb. Having decided which response is likely to be the target, make a positive cross-check by \nconfirming the relationship with surrounding responses. \n47. Pre-flight Study.  Sound pre-flight study can help overcome much of the ambiguity present in \nradar ground mapping displays.

To avoid detection by enemy radars, strike/attack aircraft need to fly at very low altitudes when in, \nor approaching, defended airspace. The day/night, all-weather capability of strike/attack aircraft has\nbeen greatly enhanced by terrain following radars. \nHeight/Speed Considerations\n2. Height. The optimum height to fly is a balance between being so low that collision with the ground is \na real risk and being so high that the aircraft is vulnerable to interception by the enemy. Fig 1 shows how \nthe risk of collision with the ground increases with decreasing height, and exposure to enemy action \nincreases with increasing height.  This does not apply in all cases; the detection distance of a ground-\nbased radar over a flat desert or on a coastline is virtually independent of height and is mainly limited by\nrange and the curvature of the Earth.  Excluding these cases, the resulting curve of total risk shows that \n200 feet is the optimum operating level. \n11-9 Fig 1 Optimum Height to Fly \n0 200 Ft\nIncreasing HeightProbability of\nHitting Ground\nTotal Risk\nProbability \nof Enemy Hit\nIncreasingRisk\n3.Speed. The faster an aircraft can fly, the safer it is from enemy attack. However, there is a point\nwhere the penalty of increased fuel consumption in flying at supersonic speed at low level is hardly \ncompensated for by a reduction in vulnerability.  Therefore, the highest sustainable subsonic cruise \nspeed is regarded as the optimum at low level. \nSafety Factors \n4. The safety requirement for a terrain radar system is that no single failure should endanger the \nsafety of the aircraft.  Any failure must result in a safe pull-up manoeuvre.  From the fail-safe aspect, \nduplication, where feasible, is adopted. \nTerms \n5. The following terms describe the capabilities of particular systems: \na.Terrain Warning (TW).

Conventional airborne radars used for ground mapping or reconnaissance use either a \nmechanically scanning, or a planar phased array aerial, to produce a PPI display.  In order to achieve \ngood resolution it is desirable to have an azimuth beamwidth that is as narrow as possible, but since \nbeamwidth is inversely proportional to aerial size, this implies the use of large aerials.  Unless the radar \nis mounted in a large external radome with the attendant weight and aerodynamic penalties, the size of \na forward facing aerial will be restricted by the frontal area of the carrying aircraft, and in the case of a \nmechanically scanning aerial, there must also be room to accommodate the aerial movement.  A \nfurther disadvantage of forward facing transmissions is that they give advance notice of the aircraft\u2019s \napproach to the enemy\u2019s electronic scanners. \n2. Sideways-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) is used for reconnaissance, and overcomes these \ndisadvantages by looking sideways and downwards from the aircraft using a non-scanning aerial \nmounted parallel to the aircraft fuselage.  This arrangement allows the aerial to be made long, so \ngiving a narrow azimuth beamwidth and good resolution in that plane. \n3. The aerial is normally of the slotted waveguide type where one or more slotted waveguides are \nphysically attached parallel to the fore-and-aft axis of the aircraft, either along the side of the fuselage \nor in an underslung pod. A SLAR aerial for a fighter-type aircraft would typically be 3 to 5 m long \ncompared to a maximum size of about 2 m for a circular scanning aerial in a large aircraft.  The \nequipment is normally designed for two aerials, one looking to port and the other to starboard. \nOperation \n4. A beam of radar pulses is transmitted at 90\u00ba to the aircraft\u2019s fore-and-aft axis, the number of pulses \ntransmitted being proportional to the ground speed of the aircraft to maintain a series of overlapping scans.", "question": "What is the main advantage of using Sideways-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) over conventional airborne radars?", "answer": "The main advantage of using Sideways-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) over conventional airborne radars is that SLAR looks sideways and downwards from the aircraft using a non-scanning aerial mounted parallel to the aircraft fuselage.

SLAR typically operates in the K or L band and uses pulse compression techniques to retain good \nrange resolution while transmitting sufficient energy to achieve a satisfactory range performance.  In \nelevation, the beams are cosec2 in shape and are adjustable in depression angle so as to obtain the \noptimum ground illumination with changing aircraft height. \n7. The beamwidth of a linear array aerial may be determined approximately, in degrees, by 50\u03bb/D \nwhere\u03bbis the operating wavelength and D is the aerial array length. Using this approximation for a\nfighter-type aircraft installation with an aerial length of 3m, and assuming a wavelength of 1 cm, yields \na beamwidth of about 0.16\u00ba.  On a large aircraft where an aerial length might be 10 m the beamwidth \nwould be 0.05\u00ba at the same wavelength, which at a range of 10 nm equates to a linear beamwidth of \nsome 16 m (50 ft). Although this may be adequate for some situations, many reconnaissance\napplications require a narrower beamwidth.  However, since there is clearly a practical limit to the \nlength of the aerial which can be accommodated on an aircraft, an alternative approach is needed - a \ntechnique known as synthetic aperture. \n8. Synthetic Aperture.  The synthetic aperture technique relies on the aircraft movement to simulate an \naerial array much longer than the physical installation. The parameters (including phase) of the radar returns\nfrom a pulse are recorded, and then combined and processed together with returns from subsequent pulses \ntransmitted from different aircraft positions.  The effect is to synthesize an aerial with a length equal to the \ndistance flown during the period in which the data is collected.  Synthetic aperture techniques achieve useful \nimprovements, typically yielding linear resolutions an order smaller than a conventional linear array.\nHowever, this improvement is at the expense of considerable processing complexity, which, particularly if a \nnear real-time performance is needed, would preclude their use on other than large aircraft.

Cumuliform clouds are associated with rising and descending currents of air leading to turbulence, \nwhich can be severe in the case of cumulo-nimbus clouds.  The turbulence tends to retain the water \ndroplets within the cloud which increase in size until they fall as heavy precipitation.  It is this \nprecipitation, and in particular the large water drops, which reflect the radar energy and from which \nturbulence can be inferred.  Hailstones are normally covered with a film of water and tend to produce \nthe strongest echoes; gentle rain, snow, and dry ice produce the weakest echoes.  Non-turbulent, \nprincipally stratiform, clouds are not usually detected by the radar as the water droplet size is too small, \nneither can the radar detect clear air turbulence.  Normally the radar energy will penetrate the \nprecipitation of one cloud so as to be able to display echoes from clouds beyond.  However, extremely \nheavy precipitation may attenuate the radar to an extent that this penetration is not achieved. \nIso-echo Contour Display \n4. The strength of the returned radar signals varies according to the precipitation rate and, by \ninference, reflects the degree of turbulence.  However, a normal monochrome CRT display is unable to \ndiscriminate between these different signal amplitudes; clouds with significantly different degrees of \nturbulence would appear the same on the display. \n5. In order to overcome this shortcoming, a system known as Iso-echo Contour has been developed.  \nIn this system an amplitude threshold level is established, and all signals which exceed this level are \nswitched to earth (see Fig 3).   \n11-11 Fig 3 Generation of Iso-echo Display \nIso-echo Contour \nSwitching Level\nSignalAmplitude\nDisplayNormal\nCloud\nReturn\n'Black Hole'Video\nThresholdThis Part of\nSignal Switched\nto Earth\nAreas of\n\u2018Bright-up\u2019\nTime\nThe effect is to create a 'black hole' on the display corresponding to those parts of the cloud return with \nthe greatest precipitation rate (Fig 4).", "question": "What is the principle of operation of the weather radar AP3456 \u2013 11-11?", "answer": "The weather radar AP3456 \u2013 11-11 works by detecting the radar energy reflected by the large water drops in cumuliform clouds, which are associated with rising and descending currents of air leading to turbulence.

As well as the nature of the cloud target, the strength of the returning radar signal is dependent on\nthe range of the cloud.  In order to eliminate this variable, sensitivity time control (STC), or swept gain, \ntechniques are used in which the receiver gain is lowered at the instant each pulse is fired, and then \nprogressively increased according to a predetermined law.  This ensures that echoes from distant \nranges are amplified more than those from close range.\n8.

The principle purposes of airborne intercept (AI) radar are to detect and identify airborne targets \n(including those below the radar horizon of ground-based installations) to enable the timely use of \nappropriate tactics and weapons.  Ideally, AI radar should be able to track, measure flight parameters \nof, and predict flight paths for multiple targets simultaneously, so as to provide the fighter crew with an \noverall air picture. \n2. The radar will also be required to provide the necessary cueing and guidance signals for air \nlaunched weapons such as radar guided missiles.  At closer range, the radar should provide accurate \nsteering and range information so that a visual identification of a target can be accomplished.  In close \ncombat, the radar may be required to provide range and angle rate data for gun aiming, and range \ncueing for infra-red (IR) homing missiles.  Radar angle data may also be used to slave IR missile \nheads onto a target to facilitate IR lock before missile launch. \n3. Such diverse requirements cannot be met with one type of radar transmission, and modern AI \nradars are able to operate in a number of modes, the most appropriate being selected for any \nparticular situation.  The capabilities of these various modes can only be realized with the aid of an \nairborne computer capable of processing the signals and of providing the necessary inputs to a \nsynthetic display. \nOperating Modes \n4. Whereas a non-coherent pulse radar can readily be used to determine the range of a target, it \ncannot determine velocity.  Furthermore, it is not suitable for detecting airborne targets against a \nterrestrial background, since the target echo would be indistinguishable from the ground returns.  \nConversely, a pure CW radar cannot be used to determine range but can be used to determine the \nradial velocity of a target by measuring the Doppler shift in the radar echo.  Since only the Doppler shift \n(ie not the absolute frequency) of the returning signal is measured, a simple CW radar cannot \ndiscriminate between multiple targets which occur in the beam at the same time.", "question": "What are the two types of radars that can determine both range and radial velocity of a target?", "answer": "The two types of radars that can determine both range and radial velocity of a target are a Frequency Modulated (FM) CW radar and a Pulse radar."}, {"context": "Another \ndisadvantage of pure CW is that it requires separate transmitting and receiving aerials.  Thus, although \npure CW on its own is not a suitable transmission type for an AI radar, an AI radar will usually have a \nCW mode, which is used to illuminate a target for missile guidance.  In this mode the aircraft radar only \ntransmits, the receiver being in the missile seeker head. \n5. Clearly some combination of the characteristics of both pulse and CW is desirable and this is \nachieved in a type of transmission known as pulsed Doppler (PD) or interrupted continuous wave \n(ICW).  In this transmission type, the pulses are coherent with respect to each other, i.e. they have a \nconstant phase relationship.  The coherency allows a Doppler shift (and consequently velocity) to be \nmeasured; the pulse characteristic means that range can be determined, although, in practice, not as \neasily as in a simple pulse radar. \nClutter \n6. One of the desirable features of AI radar is the ability to detect targets against a terrestrial \nbackground.  This ability is conferred by the CW element of the transmission.  However, in addition to \nthe Doppler shift in the received echo generated by the target, there will also be a spectrum of \nfrequencies returned from the ground as a result of the carrier\u2019s speed.

The Doppler frequency sensed by the main beam will vary with radar angle, terrain profile, \nand, of course, with the carrier aircraft\u2019s velocity.  The result, in the case of a simple CW transmission, \nis to produce a clutter spectrum similar to that shown in Fig 1b.  In some systems the peaks due to \naltitude and Mainlobe Clutter (MLC) can be removed using filters, to leave a band of clutter of fairly \nlevel amplitude extending either side of the central frequency by an amount equivalent to groundspeed \nDoppler shift.

The clutter problem is complicated once a pulsed transmission is considered since the \ntransmission comprises several spectral lines which can be determined by Fourier Analysis to be \nmultiples of the Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF), as shown in Fig 3a.

Since a common aerial is used for transmission and reception, the receiver is only able to accept \nreturning echoes for a proportion of the time.  As a consequence, many returning echoes will be \npartially cut off, an effect known as eclipsing; at certain ranges the echoes will be completely cut off \ngiving rise to blind ranges (see Fig 4). \n11-12 Fig 4 Eclipsing and Blind Ranges \nEclipsing Target \nEchoesThis Partof Signal\nEclipsed\nT0TimeTransmitted\nSignal\nBlind Ranges Target\nEchoesSignal CompletelyCut off\n10. The problem of blind ranges can be alleviated by jittering or staggering the PRF so that no \nparticular range remains blind permanently.  The technique also helps to spread the eclipsing effect \nmore uniformly over different target ranges.  In very high PRF systems the loss of received power \ncaused by eclipsing can be compensated for in the signal processing by integrating pulses. \nVelocity and Range Ambiguities - The Influence of PRF \n11. In any pulsed radar system it is essential, if ambiguities are to be avoided, for each echo to be \nassociated with its own transmitted pulse. \n12. Velocity Ambiguity.  In the example of a received spectrum of an interrupted continuous wave \nradar at Fig 3b, the pulse repetition frequency is sufficiently high to allow clutter free regions to exist, \nand if the target\u2019s Doppler shifted frequency falls into this clear region it is relatively easy to detect \nsince it is competing only with noise.  If, however, the pulse repetition frequency is reduced, the \nspectral lines become closer together until, at some point, the clutter spectra overlap (see Fig 5).  In \naddition to the increased problem of detecting the wanted return against the clutter background, it is \nalso impossible to determine to which particular spectrum the return belongs and it is therefore not \npossible to measure velocity unambiguously.  A sufficiently high PRF must be used to prevent the \nmaximum Doppler shift from appearing in the adjacent spectrum.", "question": "What is eclipsing in the context of air intercept radar?", "answer": "Eclipsing in the context of air intercept radar refers to the effect where many returning echoes are partially cut off because the receiver is only able to accept returning echoes for a proportion of the time, as a common aerial is used for transmission and reception."}, {"context": "AP3456 \u2013 11-12 - Air Intercept Radar \nRevised Jun 10 Page 6 of 1111-12 Fig 6 High/Medium Doppler Spectra \nFig 6a High PRF \nTgt Tgt Tgtf0f0 f0\nf\nFig 6b Medium PRF \nTgt TgtTgtf0 f0 f0\nf\n11-12 Fig 7 High/Medium Pulse Spacing \nFig 7a High PRF time\nFig 7b Medium PRF \n1 2 3Range Bins\nntime\nThese range bins act effectively as separate radar receivers, each dealing with a different range band, \nenabling the clutter to be divided between them.

A medium PRF mode requires processing for each range bin and is therefore more complex than \na high PRF mode.  This complexity is further increased by the need to resolve both velocity and range \nambiguities.  Moreover, there are no clutter free regions such as those shown in Fig 3b, and so \napproaching targets are more difficult to detect than in the high PRF mode.  The ideal solution is to \nprovide operator choice of high or medium PRF modes. \n16. Many AI radars can use a medium PRF mode, typically in the range 10 kHz to 30 kHz.  Although a \nmedium PRF system suffers from both range and velocity ambiguities, neither is particularly severe \nand they can be resolved using the technique of multiple PRFs. \n17.Range Resolution.The principle involved in multiple PRF ranging is shown in Fig 9. The\ntransmission is first made at PRF 1 which generates a series of ambiguous range values.  The PRF is \nthen altered to PRF 2 and a further set of ambiguous ranges obtained.

In practice three PRFs are normally used for velocity resolution in order to cater for positive and \nnegative relative velocities, and a further two PRFs for range resolution.  Both the ranging and velocity \nPRFs must be transmitted during the period of target illumination. \nHigh PRF Radar - FM Ranging \n20. Whereas a medium PRF radar is usually considered the better option in an agile close combat \nsituation, a high PRF radar is generally a better choice when the task is to detect and engage fast, low-\nflying aircraft at maximum missile range.  By using a high PRF, at least twice that of the highest \nDoppler frequency shift expected, velocity ambiguity can be avoided, but the system would suffer from \nmultiple ambiguities in range.  Unfortunately, the technique of using multiple PRFs to resolve the \nambiguities is impractical at PRFs above about 20 kHz as it is difficult to provide a sufficient number of \nrange bins and high PRF radars typically employ PRFs in excess of 200 kHz.  An alternative ranging \ntechnique is therefore necessary and the method employed is that of frequency modulation (FM).  \nSince the transmission type is interrupted continuous wave (ICW), this mode of operation is often \nknown as FMICW. \n21.

The principal task of a maritime radar is to search an expanse of ocean for maritime targets which \nmay range in size from a submarine periscope to an aircraft carrier.  Ideally the system should allow \nfriendly and hostile targets to be distinguished, and may have the capability to identify surface vessels \nbroadly. The radar performance should be such that the aircraft can remain outside the engagement \nenvelope of any hostile vessel\u2019s weapon systems. \n2. Having located a target, the system should be capable of tracking it and, if necessary, of \nprosecuting an attack either directly or by relaying target information to other units.  In anti-submarine \noperations the radar transmissions may be employed to deter an enemy from surfacing, thus \nfrustrating attempts at using its periscope for target identification, raising communication masts, \nrecharging batteries, or firing surface launched missiles. \n3. In addition to its primary role, a maritime radar will typically be able to operate in weather \navoidance and ground mapping (navigation) modes, and will usually have IFF interrogation facilities. \nRadar Type and Parameters \n4. Maritime radars are invariably pulsed radars and, in common with the majority of airborne radars, \nusually operate in I, or occasionally J, band.  Although using higher frequencies would permit smaller \naerials or better resolution, in the maritime environment there would be an unacceptable increase in \nclutter returns from water droplets in the atmosphere, such as from blown spray. \n5. In order to achieve an acceptable level of resolution, while still being able to operate at long range \nwhen necessary, the technique of pulse compression using linear frequency modulation is often used.  \nPulse compression techniques are explained in Volume 11, Chapter 2.  Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) \ntechnology is employed in many maritime radars to achieve pulse compression. \n6. Pulse compression techniques using linear frequency modulation make the radar resilient to \nbroadband noise jamming since the receiver tends to ignore any signals which are not appropriately \ncoded.", "question": "What is the primary role of a maritime radar?", "answer": "The primary role of a maritime radar is to search an expanse of ocean for maritime targets which may range in size from a submarine periscope to an aircraft carrier.

The maritime radar environment can be very noisy and cluttered since, in addition to internal and \nexternal noise, clutter returns may be produced, for example, from sea movement, waves, flocks of \nbirds, and porpoises.  Such returns can easily mask the desired returns from small targets such as \nperiscopes and masts and thus, although much of the external noise is filtered out in the pulse \ncompression process, only rarely are unprocessed radar returns displayed.  Instead, the majority of \nsystems employ one or more filtering or integrating techniques to 'clean-up' the radar picture \n(see Volume 11, Chapter 3). \n8. In constant false alarm rate (CFAR) receivers a voltage threshold level is set, and returns are \nonly processed as targets if their signal strength exceeds this level.  The threshold level is \nconstantly adjusted in line with a running average value of the received signal.   \n9. Integration may be applied on a pulse-to-pulse or on a scan-to-scan basis.

Unfortunately, small targets such as submarine \nmasts and periscopes may often fail to clear these threshold levels since they will often be physically \nmasked in a rough sea.   \nScanning \n10. The scan pattern of a maritime radar may be either a forward hemisphere sector scan, or a 360\u00ba \nscan. However, in the latter case only rarely is a full 360\u00ba achieved since in virtually all installations\nthere will be some screening by the aircraft fuselage or components.  In addition where a 360\u00ba scan is \navailable it is normally possible to restrict transmissions to certain sectors, either to increase the data \nrate from an area of interest, or to deny an enemy any EW information from the transmissions.  The \nradar scanner will usually be stabilized in the horizontal and vertical planes to compensate for aircraft\nmanoeuvre and in some systems the scanner tilt may be controlled automatically to restrict \ntransmissions in accordance with the selected range scale.   \nTarget Tracking \n11. One of the facilities of a maritime radar is the ability to track a number of targets automatically.  In \na typical system the radar computer divides the search area into a matrix of cells, into which targets \nare allocated.  Once a target has been identified by the operator a computer file is opened, and as the \ntarget moves from one cell to another the track and speed are calculated and the file updated.  \nProblems can occur with rapidly manoeuvring targets and with large targets where the radar return \noccupies more than one cell.  In these cases it may be preferable for the operator to allocate a \nmanually assessed track and speed to the target.  The efficiency of an auto-tracking system is highly \ndependent on the suppression of unwanted returns since these can cause the computer to overload as \nit attempts to associate false targets with established tracks or to generate new, but false, tracks. \nDisplays \n12.", "question": "What are the two main types of displays used in maritime radar?", "answer": "The two main types of displays used in maritime radar are the A-scope and the PPI."}, {"context": "Displays \n12.
