[{"context": "The Medicare Appeals Process:   \nReforms Needed to Ensure Beneficiary Access  \nNovember 17, 2020 \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nMedicare provides health coverage for more than 61 million Americans.1 Given that the incidence of \ncancer increases with age, the Medicare program is  vitally important to millions of Americans who are \nundergoing active cancer treatment, are cancer su rvivors or who have not yet developed cancer. Yet, \nwithout Congressional action in the next few year s, the Medicare Trust Fund, will become insolvent.2 \nConsidering the forthcoming pressure to shore up th is essential health program, Congress is apt to \nconsider policies that would shift costs more to enrollees and/or tighten program benefits. To the \nextent that Congressional action results in the us e of more utilization management tools the result \nwould likely mean beneficiaries would more often ha ve to use the appeals process in order to access \nmedically necessary products and services.  \nPublic and private payers increasingly employ a va riety of measures to minimize their liability for \npaying for high-cost services , such as cancer therapies.3 As a result, cancer patients increasingly have \nto go through appeals or exceptions processes in order to access medically necessary drugs or \nservices \u2013 either because their prescribed product or service is subject to utilization management \ntools or because their insurer may choose not to cove r a particular therapy or service as part of its \nbenefit design. Without coverage for a needed servic e or treatment, cancer patients face having to \npay the full cost out of pocket or making the difficu lt decision to forego care that could save their \nlives.   \nTo better understand how the Medicare program\u2019s appeals process works for beneficiaries who have \na history of cancer, this paper analyzes the existi ng appeals processes used by the Medicare program \nby walking through the Medicare Part A and B appeal s process (including a discussion of an expedited \nprocess) using hypothetical patient profiles as illust rations. The paper then details the process used \nby Medicare private plans \u2013 Part C and D plans \u2013 to control costs and the process a beneficiary would \nundergo to obtain access to a Part C or Part D covered benefit.", "question": "", "answer": ""}, {"context": "The paper concludes with \n \n1 According to the 2020 Medicare Trustees\u2019 Report, in 2019 Medicare covered 61.2 million people: 52.6 million \naged 65 and older and 8.7 million persons with disabiliti es. 2020 Annual Report  of the Boards of  Trustees of the \nFederal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Me dical Insurance Trust Funds.

Ther e are many rules and requirements regarding \nwhat can be appealed, what is needed to file an appeal, the timeframes by which an enrollee has the \nopportunity to file an appeal, and timeframes under which a decision is made. Beneficiaries can be at \na disadvantage if they are unfamiliar with the system.  \nCumulative timeframes may create barriers to care: From a beneficiary\u2019s perspective, the number \nof levels of review can be daunting and can deter a beneficiary from filing an appeal. In addition, \nmultiple levels of appeal delay a beneficiary\u2019s access to medically appropriate products or services. \nEven though the appeals process allows for expedite d consideration, each level of review has various \ntimeframes by which the reviewing entity must act.  Adding up all of those timeframes can result in a \nbeneficiary \u2013 even one experiencing, by definition , exigent circumstances for which expedited review \nis warranted \u2013 who is unable to access the product or  service that is on appeal for several days or \nweeks (depending on how many levels of review are undergone). On the provider side, providers \nreport delays in being able to provide cancer ca re because of having to wait for approval from \nMedicare plans (Medicare Advantage (MA) or Part D plans) to override utilization management tools. \nEvidence suggests that plans\u2019 initial denials are often overturned : In 2019, the Health and Human \nServices (HHS) Office of the Inspector General released a report on the Part D appeals process and \nfound that enrollees and providers appealed very  few preauthorization and payment denials, but \namong those that were appealed, Medicare Advantage  (MA) plans overturned 75 percent of their own \ndenials.4 This data suggests that MA plans\u2019 default is to deny claims, regardless of the medical \nnecessity involved. \nLack of information on the utilization of the appeals process hinders progress : Medicare does not \nroutinely publish information about the utilization of the appeals process \u2013 including information \nsorted by program and level of appeal.", "question": "", "answer": ""}, {"context": "Without that  information, it can be challenging to ascertain \nwhat specific improvements are needed.  \nMany beneficiaries do not ex ercise their appeals rights : Unfortunately, it is not known how many \nbeneficiaries do not exercise their appeals rights, ei ther because they were not informed of their right \nto appeal or because they were daunted by the process. Beneficiaries might choose to pay out of \npocket for services that should be covered by Medi care or choose to forgo care altogether instead of \nappealing, which could have negative implicatio ns for their overall health and wellbeing.   \n  \n \n4 U.S.\u00a0Department\u00a0of\u00a0Health\u00a0and\u00a0Human\u00a0Services\u2010Office\u00a0of\u00a0Inspecto r\u00a0General.\u00a0Some\u00a0Medicare.\u00a0Part\u00a0D\u00a0Beneficiaries\u00a0\nFace\u00a0Avoidable\u00a0Extra\u00a0Steps\u00a0That\u00a0Can\u00a0Delay\u00a0or\u00a0Prevent\u00a0Access\u00a0to\u00a0 Prescribed\u00a0Drugs.\u00a0Revised\u00a0September\u00a02019.\u00a0\nAccessed\u00a0April\u00a02020.\u00a0 https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei\u201009\u201016\u201000411.pdf .", "question": "", "answer": ""}, {"context": "3 \n POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY \nThe Medicare appeals process is confusing and can be cumbersome and time-c onsuming, particularly \nfor someone who is also battling a serious illness.

Approximately 37 percent of Medicare beneficiaries choose \nto enroll in these private plans.5 \nPart D Medicare Part D covers outpatient pres cription drugs. It is administered entirely \nthrough private plans that contract with Medicare. Approximately 47.2 million \nbeneficiaries are enrolled in Part D plans,6 other beneficiaries may have another source \nof coverage such as a retiree benefit. \n Each part of the Medicare program maintains separate rules and regulations regarding how \nbeneficiaries can file appeals in order to acce ss medically necessary care.", "question": "", "answer": ""}, {"context": "While there are some \nsimilarities between the various rules and regula tions, there are also si gnificant differences. \n \n5 2020 Trustees Report.  \n6 Id. at 16.", "question": "", "answer": ""}, {"context": "4 \n Beneficiaries are often unfamiliar with the rules re garding whether and how to file an appeal, and the \nprocess can seem daunting.

In some cases, the \nbeneficiary may have assigned their appeal rights to  a provider or supplier in which case the provider \nfiles the appeal.17 However, providers can only represent a be neficiary in an appeal if the provider \nwaives any rights for payment from the beneficiary involving the services at issue. This policy is \ndesigned to protect the beneficiary, as the benefici ary could otherwise be exposed to significant cost-\nsharing as a result of the appeal.18  \nTimeframes for Filing Appeals \nBeneficiaries have a limited time in which to file a Medicare appeal (see Table 2). Under the Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rules, a request is considered to have been filed as of the date \nit is received by the MAC. MACs will also allow an extra 5 days beyond the time limit for requesting a \nredetermination (appeal) in order to account for mail delivery.19  \nExtensions : CMS regulations allow for these timeframes to  be extended if there is good cause shown \nfor late filing. Generally, this bar is high for provid ers and suppliers, but more lenient for beneficiaries. \nBeneficiaries can demonstrate good cause in a numb er of ways, including: circumstances beyond the \nbeneficiary\u2019s control (such as physical or mental impairments); damage to or destruction of the \nbeneficiary\u2019s medical records; or a beneficiary\u2019s seri ous illness or the serious illness or death in the \nbeneficiary\u2019s immediate family.20  \nLevels of Review \nThere are five levels of review for Part A and Part B services, and beneficiaries must file appeals within \ncertain statutory timeframes.  \n  \n \n15 For information on co-insurance related to Part A services, see https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-\ncosts/medicare-costs-at-a-glance . \n16 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv ices.

There are many rules and \nrequirements regarding what can be appealed, what is needed to file an appeal, the timeframes by \nwhich an enrollee may file an appeal, and timeframes for a decision to be made.  \nBeneficiaries are at a disadvantage because of thei r lack of familiarity with the system. The private \nplans and contractors that operate Part C and D, on the other hand, have an advantage given their \nfamiliarity with the program and expertise regarding  appeals. While Medicare tracks the number of \nappeals filed each year, this number excludes th ose individuals who did not engage in the appeals \nprocess, either because they are not made aware of its existence or because they feel overwhelmed or \ndaunted by the process.  \nBeneficiaries are also at a disadvantage because in many cases, they are undergoing a health event \u2013 \nin some cases a health event significant enough to  warrant an expedited appeal \u2013 and physically may \nnot be up to the task of contending with an  unknown and at times cumbersome process. Many \nbeneficiaries do not have immediate family members,  friends, or caregivers who can assist them with \nthe appeals process, and even those that do wi ll also need the help of individuals who are \nknowledgeable about the appeals process.  \nOver the years Medicare has made improvements to the appeals process.

However, the language in the \nprocess is anything but simple. Medicare has diffe rent rules and regulations depending on whether \nthe beneficiary is filing an inquiry, grievance,130 or request for coverage. While to a certain extent it \nmakes sense from a plan/program perspective to co mpartmentalize the various issues, such things \nare not intuitive from a beneficiary perspective. Because the beneficiary is not familiar with the \nprogram vernacular, it may be challenging for them to communicate their concerns.  \nFor example, the rules vary depending on the perceived intent of the beneficiary. For example, in \nsome circumstances the beneficiary may be simply ma king an \u201cinquiry\u201d as to coverage, in which case \nthe request could be classified as a grievance (which is not appealable). However, it is possible that \nthe beneficiary\u2019s \u201cinquiry\u201d was more akin to a reques t for coverage of an item/service, which would be \nconsidered a coverage determination (and thus  something the beneficiary could appeal).  \nIn addition, language used in the appeals process is slightly different depending on the rules specific \nto the program. While this may make sense from a pro gram perspective, it can be incredibly confusing \nfrom a beneficiary perspective.  \nRecommendation : The Medicare program should \nexamine the appeals process from the beneficiary \nperspective.

In Part C, if a beneficiary requests it, th e MA plan must expedite the request if the plan \ndetermines that applying the standard timeframe \u201ccould  seriously jeopardize the life or health of the \nenrollee or the enrollee\u2019s ability to regain maximum function.\u201d However, in Part D if the physician \ndetermines an expedited appeal is needed, the appeal is expedited without the Part D plan (or Medicare) making an independent assessment as to the sense of urgency.  \nRecommendation : The Medicare program should \nensure that a consistent standard is applied across \nthe program to determine what constitutes an \nexpedited determination. In so doing, Medicare \nshould err on the side of caution and ensure that \nbeneficiaries do not experience delays in accessing \nmedically appropriate care. \nImplement more direct  oversight of the \nappeals process \nThere are several instances in the Medicare rules th at require plans to perform self-audits to ensure \nthat certain processes are being followed. For example,  Part C and D plans are required to audit their \nown appeals and grievance process for the presence of errors and institute the appropriate quality \nimprovement projects as needed.131 Medicare does require plans to comply with the rules and \nrequirements concerning the appeals process \u2013 in cluding the timelines \u2013 as a condition of their \ncontract with the Medicare program. Plans that do not comply may face sanctions or contract \ntermination. However, in order for these requiremen ts to be meaningful, the Medicare program needs \nto devote significant resources to oversee that  plans are complying with these requirements.  \nEach year, Medicare audits a certain number of Part C and D plans to determine the extent to which \nthese plans are in compliance with Medicare rules and regulations, including the rules related to \nappeals.132 CMS has the authority to impose sanctions, civil monetary penalties, and can terminate \nplans that are not in compliance.
